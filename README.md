# E-Book Compiler for r/nosleep

My [girlfriend](https://github.com/adelas) is a big fan of the stories posted on Reddit's [r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep). Often, stories are posted in parts. We're on holiday in the carribbean right now and she wanted to read the stories while on the beach, where there's no Wi-Fi. I came up with the idea of getting the stories on her Amazon Kindle. However, copying and pasting tons of stories manually is rather cumbersome. I figured that I could write some magic to take of this for me.

This repo is just a collection of a bunch Python scripts I quickly hacked up in order to automate most of the process. Maybe you'll find parts of it useful. Maybe not. This repo is mostly here for myself.
