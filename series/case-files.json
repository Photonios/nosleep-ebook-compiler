        "title": "Case File #1 The Lightning Man",
        "body": "A week or so ago I was actually searching through some of the more bizarre documents released by the Freedom of Information Act when I came across a download link for a folder, just nestled in between some of the various case files. Interest was had and I downloaded it. Contained within my little mystery folder were hundreds, possibly even over a thousand case files not shown on the regular FOIA site. I browsed through a couple and noticed a few things immediately. Every document was written by a group with a Federal Designation of Organization 440, that every case took an intense and rather serious approach to paranormal entities, and that there is literally no rhyme nor reason for the order of the files.\n\nI'm going to make a serious attempt to type out these case files and find more information on the group and people mentioned in the documents. NoSleep, prepare yourselves for information I don't think we were meant to know...\n\n*Case File: 001-653*\n\n*Case File Date: 06/24/1981*\n\n*Location: Birming, Oregon*\n\n*Subject: Randy Smith*\n\n*Entity: The Lightning Man*\n\n*The following report comes from several crumpled sheets of paper found at the residence of Mr. Smith.*\n\nWe have a legend in our town, one of those little, local folk tales.\n\nThe Lightning Man.\n\nThe story goes that the Lightning Man is some kind of ghost or something. Spooky paranormal shit, whatever, every town has creepy stuff. Anyways, people have been seeing the Lightning Man for years during...well...lightning storms. Someone would look out a window and POW! Flash of lightning. Figure in the distance.\n\nMost people usually describe him as a tall, humanoid figure made up entirely of nerves and muscle. I guess that it makes sense. Lightning is electrical and nerves deal with electricity or something of that nature. I don't know. Not a medical student or anything. So yeah, he's this tall, sinewy creature. Arms longer than nature usually permits. Claw-like hands. Definitely a 'stuff of nightmares' creature. But the trademark thing that every Lightning Man story has in it is the eyes. Most people describe them as two balls of electricity resting in the eye sockets that left a haunting afterimage in it's wake.\n\nUp until a few weeks ago it really was just a story for me. \n\nI moved out of my parent's house and got myself an old house on the edge of town. Wasn't perfect but the price was right so I couldn't complain. It isn't anything special. Two stories, medium sized house. Quite a lot of room for one guy. The real draw for me were the fields though. My house is surrounded by fields on three sides and after that they end in forest. I enjoyed the earthy feel, it gave off a different feel than the more urban surrounding I had at my parents house. \n\nThe creepy shit started up maybe two weeks ago. I was sitting at home watching tv one night, the weather channel. Thing is the weatherman said that we were having record highs for temperature and were in a drought. Look outside and there was a heavy storm. Like, the kind that topples stuff on your porch and makes the house creak nonstop. And it definitely wasn't hot. If anything I'd say it was unseasonably cold. Definitely weird but I shrugged it off as a freak storm that hadn't quite hit town yet.\n\nFinally got tired and head upstairs to my bedroom. Walked by my window and CRACK! Flash of lightning. My window looks out one of the fields and right at the edge of the field where it met up with the border of the forest I thought I saw him. Standing. Lumbering maybe. It was real quick so I thought I was crazy. But when I looked away in the darkness of the room I still had two small dots of light burned in to my vision temporarily. Like any rational man I shrugged it off and went to bed. Didn't give it a second thought.\n\nI woke up to more lightning. It was still really dark outside so I figured I had gotten maybe an hour or two of sleep. Looked at my alarm. 8:00. It was the morning. First thing I did was throw on the news, at this point I assumed we were getting a freak storm and I wanted to check things out. News was normal. Threw it over to the weather, hot and sunny. No way. No how. Grabbed my phone and called my parents. Or I tried to at least. My phone was dead.\n\nCRASH! More lightning. The storm outside was relentless. I'm sure it had to be bordering on hurricane strength. My male bravado won out and I decided to try and brave the storm. I wrestled the door open and fought against the wind and the rain just to take several steps on to my porch. CRASH! Another flash of lightning and there he was. Much closer than last night but still in the middle of the field. I could see that his arms were so long that the clawed fingers actually drug across the ground. This was even more impressive because the Lightning Man had to be almost seven feet tall. At least that's what I remember thinking at the time. Hard to really good measure of something when it's still a bit away and only visual for two, maybe three seconds. \n\nThat was enough to kill my ideas about leaving. I holed up in my house for the rest of the day and fell asleep huddled up in my bathroom with all the doors locked. \n\nThe next day was much the same. Actually...the entire week was this way. I'd wake up to find the storm still raging, phone still dead, and the rest of the world oblivious to my little prison. And then the power went out.\n\nI've spent this entire week fumbling around my house just trying to survive hearing the crash of lightning every once in awhile. Every time I had to leave the bathroom to get food or to check the weather I'd have to pass a window. And every time lightning would flash and I'd see those eyes creep closer and closer. Last time I checked the Lightning Man was at my window.\n\nA few hours ago the power came back on, although the lights have been flickering on and off since. I slowly crept  through my house and grabbed a pen and paper. If I am going to die here then I want everyone to know exactly what happened, that The Lightning Man is no legend. He's real. \n\nI can only take comfort in the fact that I have blocked off the windows and that no lightning can get in here. I will die eventually, but at least it won't be at the hands of that monster. Now if only the damn lights stopped blinking.\n\nMom, Dad, I- \n\n(Secrets: The writing at this point on the paper became very rushed and ran together, I'm typing it out normal for all of our sakes.)\n\nHe's in the house. I don't know how but he's here. I can see the eyes. And he can see me. Closer. Closer. Ran to other room but claw hit side. Felt intense electricity. Hurt. Bad.\n\n*The writing stops there.*\n\n*Action Taken: Two agents slipped in to investigation team. They found and concealed the final notes of Mr. Smith. The body was never found and it was made in to a missing persons case.*\n\n*Analysis: The Lightning Man appears to be a spectral entity that does not rely on lightning but on the sudden appearance and absence of light. A flash of light should do, although lightning probably sustains a physical form for the being much better than a simple ceiling light. The people of Birming most likely associated the entity to lightning due to the light flashes from the storms they commonly receive. As to Mr. Smith's death he was most likely impaled or ensnared by the claws of the Lightning Man and electrocuted to death, abducted to whatever plane the beast uses as a lair. The storm that appeared around Mr. Smith's residence may have actually occurred in another plane of existence, capture of the entity necessary for further theories and answers.*\n\n*The Lightning Man(Subject 653) has been authorized for capture and study under The Paranormal Defense Act. Contact ______ ______* (Secrets: Literally the only thing redacted from this document was this name.) *for further information.*\n\n*Case Update: Subject 653 caught and contained at the Northeast Branch. Entity is contained through a complex system of magnets, electric fields, and flashing low light bursts. Constant study and experimentation of Subject 653 will now begin on regular intervals with updates sent via PRB Report.* (Secrets: Not sure what PRB stands for.) \n\n*Case File: Closed.*\n\nSo yeah. Case File One. Intense way to start up a series of documents if you ask me. I've scanned through some more, looks like they have interviews with people, unsolved cases, some facility reports, just stuff. Stuff I knew NoSleep would appreciate.  \n\nI've got a desire to get all this information out now. The original download location for the file is gone. Not surprising. Personally I think this folder wasn't supposed to be released to the public. Maybe someone messed up, or wanted them to get caught. I'll have to keep reading and sharing to know for sure. Stay safe NoSleep."

        "title": "Case File #2 Banner Station",
        "body": "*Case File: 002-Volos*\n\n*Case File Date: 08/25/1986*\n\n*Location: Banner Station, Antarctica*\n\n*Subject: ASSTF (Anti-Soviet Special Task Force) Unit Seven*\n\n*Entity: Volos, Slavic Deity of Death*\n\n*The first reports are from members of ASSTF Unit Seven*\n\n*Captain James Alders, Commanding Officer of Operation Novolazarevskaya*\n\nDay One: Our team moved into base under the cover of United States researchers. Novolazarevskaya Station is roughly 10 miles north of the newly dubbed Banner Station. Mission parameters are to investigate claims and info leaks that Novolazarevskaya Station is actually a research base for Soviet super weapons. If we confirm the presence of said weapons we are to terminate any and all personnel and retrieve or destroy the weapons and research notes. \n\nMy squad is composed of fifteen Special Forces Men as well as myself. A civilian by the name of Matthew Hoffer has also been assigned to our unit as a specialist. Not sure what he specializes in. Whole thing is definitely off, but I'm not payed to complain. \n\nDay Seven: Everyone is settled in. Weld and Shaffer got in to a scuffle. Nothing out of the ordinary. Sending two men to scout out the Soviet Station tomorrow. Also, Hoffer is being exceptionally reclusive. He could just be intimidated by being stuck in this frozen hell with a bunch of spec ops guys but I'm keeping an eye on him regardless. He also hasn't contributed much and when I asked him what exactly he was here for he told me \"I'm only to act in case of certain situations.\" and then flashes me this Federal paper about nondisclosure. Secrets in a secret mission. I hate this James Bond shit.\n\nDay Eight: Allers and Weld reported back. Novolazarevskaya Station for all intents and purposes appears to be abandoned, right down to the front door being left wide open. This is far beyond what I expected. Daniels and I talked things over and decided it was probably a bio weapon gone wrong. He assured me that we have the gear to let us check out the base. I'm sending five men, Reynolds in charge. They are to do a discrete infiltration of the Station and then radio us if the facility truly is empty.\n\nDay Ten: After two days of high alert due to Reynolds' squad not reporting back we finally picked up something on radio. It was choppy and near impossible to make out but the words \"send help\" were clearly heard. Shaffer is staying here with Hoffer. The rest of us are about to head over to Novolazarevskaya Station. If I can save even one person from whatever happened I will. \n\nDay Eleven: It's been a God damn nightmare. We got to Novolazarevskaya Station and everything was just as previously reported. Front door wide open. No lights. No power. No life. I made the call to not send everyone in. Daniels was more of a doctor than he was a soldier and I had him and most of the team stay back on top of a hill maybe a quarter mile away. Weld, Osa, Mendez, and myself crept up to the wide open doors that led inside. \n\nThe station itself is comprised of three different research modules as well as a living quarters. Weld and Osa searched through the first research module while Mendez and I took the second. Besides the lack of power and noise things were pretty normal. No signs of a scuffle. No bullet holes. No blood. We all met back up at the third research module, which you had to walk through to get to the living quarters. \n\nI should have known what was coming the second we cracked the door open and that smell wafted out to us, the scent of blood. And yet I stood there completely horrified at the scene before me. It was truly horrible. This was clearly the scene of a vicious slaughter. Blood and small chunks of meat splashed against the walls and ceiling. Halves of men lay strewn about over counters and chairs. One corpse must've been slammed in to the wall so hard that the body had squished halfway in to the wall and it had stuck in place. And there was one in the corner of the room that will haunt me till the day I die. The man was slumped against the wall with his face pointed straight up to the ceiling. His jaw must've been severely dislocated as a severed arm was shoved down his throat hand first, almost up to the shoulder. For some reason he just kept standing out to me so I looked closer, his eyes were clearly focused on the arm during his last moments, meaning he was fully conscious when this happened to him. Besides that he looked like any other Soviet. \n\nWe did a quick check of the room, none of the corpses belonged to my team. The four of us gathered at the door to the living quarters and pried a severed arm off the handle. Son of a bitch must have been trying to escape the room and didn't quite make it. Osa tore the door open and Mendez and myself aimed our guns and entered the room. \n\nThe living quarters had bunk beds lining each wall and it was pretty standard. We did a quick sweep of the room. There was nothing under the beds, nothing of note in the cabinets, nothing in the room at all. Just another door at the far side of the room that probably led to the kitchen. While Osa and Mendez searched the room more thoroughly Weld and I took the kitchen door. He swung it open and I trained my rifle on the darkness. \n\nI was immediately struck to the ground. Something was flailing on top of me. As I struggled with whatever it was I vaguely heard Weld call out for the others to help with something. I couldn't make out the words nor see what was attacking me. I threw out a few heavy punches that connected to what I assumed to be a face. My flashlight had fallen with my rifle when I had been knocked down. My assailant recoiled and moved away from me. I scrambled over to my gun, and more importantly my light source and started waving it around. I finally found who had attacked me in the corner of the room. Wilkens, one of the men I had sent with Reynolds three days ago. He was curled up and pressed against the wall as much as he could manage, clutching on to what looked like an old book. \n\nWe tried to talk to him for several minutes but couldn't get anything out of him. There was nothing in the kitchen either. I made the call to leave. We weren't finding anything and I was getting unnerved by the whole situation.\n\nWe met up with everyone outside and told them what happened. Against my advice Daniels asked to be taken to the third research module. His face was as pale as the snow when he returned. \n\n\"Do you think it was an animal attack?\" I remember him asking.\n\"Dunno. What kind of animal does all of that without actually eating any of the bodies?\"\nHe shrugged and everyone spent the ride back to Banner in silence. Except for Wilkens, he had begun to make pained noises every minute or so. Still holding that damn book. No one can get him to let go of it.\n\nWe got back to base and I couldn't even tell Hoffer and Shaffer what happened. I just dragged myself over to my office and started writing this report. Had to get my thoughts out. Daniels has Wilkens over in the medroom and is checking his health as well as trying to get him to talk. I'm going to drink myself to sleep, rules be damned.\n\n*Emerson Daniels' Report and interview of Brian Wilkens*\n\nIt's the eleventh day of Operation Novolazarevskaya. While I was initially placed on this team, due to my past training in psychological health, to help my fellow soldiers cope with the harsh environment we've been placed in, it now seems like I'll be using what I know to find out what happened to Wilkens, Reynolds, and the others. \n\nHe's ok physically, besides not sleeping for a few days, lack of water, food, etc. Another curious thing is that book. I've gotten some good glances of it and it looks old, really old. I saw what looked like snakes and some form of cattle or boar on the cover, which seems to be made of some heavily treated and worn leather. No writing on it that I can see but I doubt it's in English. Wilkens must have grabbed it while they were over at the Soviet's station. My training has taught me a few things: When the mind snaps due to a terrible sight, situation, etc., the person in question may latch on to an object of importance. Apparently this book is important, but why? I think I'll try to take it from him in a bit after the sedatives I give him kick in.\n\nQuick update, took the book from Wilkens. Leafed through it a bit. Not written in English, not really surprising. I believe it could be an archaic form of Russian. I'm not sure though since I don't speak a lick of the language. I think Wilkens and Kusman speak and read Russian, although Kusman is part of the missing squad. I was about to give up and had closed the book when Wilkens shot back up and looked at me. He calmly asked me to give him back the book, which I of course did. I'm not sure how he's awake so soon but he's talking again and is willing to tell me what happened at the base.\n\nDaniels: Brian, you and four others went to Novolazarevskaya Station ahead of the rest of our team to check it for survivors. What happened?\n\nWilkens:(He is stammering and putting his emphasis on the wrong parts of words. Obviously from the trauma.)  We arrived to find the place just like we were told. It was deserted, doors were wide open. I think for a minute we just stood there. Reynolds probably thinking about tactical stuff. Baker and Hurst were making ghost jokes, messing around, being stupid. Kusman and I stayed our distance initially. I personally felt something bad emanating from the whole place and from the look on Kusman's face I'm pretty sure he was feeling it too.\n\nReynolds finally gave us the order to go inside. Kusman and I to the left, Baker and Hurst to the right, Reynolds would aim center. We executed everything properly expecting something to be there. I was happy at the time to be let down. The place was abandoned but not in an eerie fashion. I was seriously expecting bloated corpses or zombies the entrance area as well as the initial two modules were clear. The only place left was the door that led to the third module and the areas beyond. My sense of foreboding was going full swing and I found myself not being able to hold by gun steady. \n\nWe entered the room to find nothing.\n\nDaniels: But I've been in that room Brian, it's covered in some of the most grotesque things I've seen done to a hum-\n\nWilkens: There was nothing there man, trust me. We moved on to the living quarters and it was empty too. Empty beds empty room, as was the rest of the building. So we started to leave the facility and that's when we saw the bodies. They were all there just as you saw. But we had been in that room maybe ten minutes prior and it was empty, what's with that shit man? \n\nSo, we searched that room, very carefully. That's how we found the book. It was just laying on one of the center tables, closed and kind of unassuming. Kusman picked it up and that's when everything went wrong. One of the corpses in the corner of the room grabbed Baker. We didn't see it move, hell I'm not even sure where the corpse initially was. Anyway, I remember it grabbing him by the arm and just pulling him away. \n\nAs this was happening some kind of black tendrils or tentacles or...something reached down from the ceiling and grabbed Reynolds. Just grabbed him around the arms, neck, I could even see them start to grab the edges of his mouth and pull. And then he was gone. He was just, just pulled up in to the ceiling. \n\nBaker's screams brought me back to the present. I looked over to see the corpse thing just tear his arm off. It looked effortless to be honest. The muscles and skin put up little resistance, or that thing was inhumanly strong. Baker, now armless, started flailing around a bit and fell over. He proceeded to just fall through the floor as if there was nothing there to begin with. The corpse thing then took Baker's arm and just...just started forcing it down it's throat, I could almost here the jaw dislocate. At this point the other corpses strewn about the room were all stirring and showing signs of...life? Unlife? Man...so fucked up. \n\nWell, Kusman, Hurst, and I bolted for the exit. Hurst reached it first, and paid for it. The door flew off it's hinges like an explosion had gone off behind it and nailed Hurst. It smashed in to the wall and Hurst was just crushed..it was a sickening noise. Everything in that room is sickening.  \n\nThose tendrils appeared again. They blocked up the now open doorway, so we could only retreat to the living quarters. I made it first and turned around to see a tendril grab Kusman just as he reached the doorway. He threw me the book for some reason and then the door slammed shut.\n\nDaniels: I've seen some of the corpses you mentioned Brian. But they weren't any members of our team, they were all Soviet researchers.\n\nWilkens: Don't you get it? We see whatever it wants us to see. You saw Soviet corpses in place of Hurst and the others because that's what it wanted.\n\nDaniels: What who wanted?\n\nWilkens: I was trapped in the back of the room. I was scared and alone. I read the book because I had to. My mother immigrated to the United States from Russia so I know a fair bit of Russian myself. The book is some kind of summoning book or spell book I think. It's definitely powerful. My guess is that the Soviets aren't holding up well and need an edge on us. Well, they turned to summoning a very old and very dead God, Volos. \n\nDaniels: Well, that warrants...study. So how did you end up getting in contact with us through the radio? Baker had it on him when he 'disappeared'. \n\nWilkens: Volos spoke to me after I had read parts of the book. He told me he'd let me go if I took the book with me. I think that was the deal. I blacked out at that point and didn't come to till I saw you holding the book. You, you didn't open it did you?\n\nDaniels: Why would that matter?\n\nWilkens: From what I read I think it acts like an invitation. Like...the corruption can only infest a place if you open it in that building. Or, something like that. I'm not really sure. I couldn't read every word to begin with and it's not easy to describe portals and shit when you're talking all archaic.\n\nWilkens refused to speak after that. He seemed tired and just curled up on the cot to sleep. I'm not sure what to make of the story he told me. It could be his brain's way of coping with the room. It just couldn't take the stress and he snapped. All I know is that I'm not touching that book again. It's getting late and I think I need sleep as well.\n\n*The final moments of Captain James Alders.*\n\nDay Fifteen\n\nI'm writing this down now in case I do not make it out of here. Almost everyone is dead. God damn it all. Daniels spoke to me briefly about it before he was killed. It's some kind of God or demon or something. I've read through his interview with Wilkens as well. Nothing in there that helps much. And Wilkens. I had no idea. He brought something back with him when we saved him. It took contol of him and he's gone. He's not human anymore.\n\nAll that's left of us is Hoffer, Fenn, Weld, and myself. We're currently holed up in my office but there's hope. Supplies are coming in by helicopter tomorrow. We're going to make a break for the outside and catch a ride. Jenny, if I don't make it and someone finds this note please know that I love you so much and I'm sorry for all the time I've had to spend away from home. If I can get home I'll never leave you again. \n\n*Mission Report from Operative Matthew Hoffer*\n\nTome of Volos is secured. The entirety of Unit Seven was lost as well as the researchers from Novolazarevskaya Station. I carried out the final plans of Captain Alders and escaped via helicopter. If the text is to be believed then Volos should only be contained at both Novolazarevskaya Station and Banner Station. I've been told that Banner is to be burned immediately, no word on Novolazarevskaya. \n\n*Mission Roster:*\n\nAlders: Shot in the leg so Operative Hoffer could escape. Last seen being dragged back to Banner Station.\n\nWeld: Flesh ripped off by Volos tendrils during the escape.\n\nShaffer: Cracked under pressure and shot himself in the head. Corpse later animated by Volos.\n\nAllers: Was lured out of safety by visions of his family fabricated by Volos. Cause of death not seen but screams heard.\n\nDaniels: Cut off from the team during Volos' attack on Banner Station. Corpse later seen with chunks missing.\n\nReynolds: Pulled in to ceiling via Volos tendrils.\n\nOsa: Impaled by Volos tendrils and torn apart.\n\nMendez: Head ripped off by possessed Wilkens.\n\nWilkens: Body completely possessed by Volos. Body assumed burned with Banner Station.\n\nKusman: Death unseen. Arm found however. Assumed dead.\n\nBaker: Arm forcibly removed and spatial displacement.\n\nHurst: Crushed against wall.\n\nFenn: Shot in the leg so Operative Hoffer could escape. Confirmed to be dead.\n\nGuerra: Ripped apart by Shaffer's corpse.\n\nGlenshaw: Cut badly during attack on Banner Station. Later bled out due to lack of medical supplies.\n\nWagner: Decapitated be ceiling Volos Tendrils.\n\nHoffer: Escaped. Retrieved objective with acceptable losses. Promotion in consideration.\n\n*Analysis: Tome of Volos is a direct gateway to Volos' realm of existence. The book also contains other passages of power that can be utilized if one can get past Volos himself. Preventative measures are in place to allow more in-depth study of the book and power that we can utilize. The Tome of Volos is to be stored in The Vault when not it direct study.*\n\n*Case Update: Banner Station has been burned along with all evidence held within, excluding that which we have confiscated. Novolazarevskaya Station remains. The Soviets refuse to destroy it but have yet to replace their former staff.*\n\n*Case File: Closed.*\n\nI'm having trouble wrapping my head around this one. I thought maybe this Organization was some sort of mini-cult or something initially. But, they slipped a man in to a Spec Ops operation during the Cold War and successfully covered it up. I don't know what I was expecting but...but yeah. Maybe this is all a little over my head. Regardless, I'm intrigued to my core and am still willing to share more if the interest is there. Take care of yourselves NoSleep."

        "body": "*Case File: 003-111*\n\n*Case File Date: 04/12/1984*\n\n*Location: Constance, Pennsylvania*\n\n*Subject: Mary Cowan, Alex Kepler*\n\n*Entity: Unknown Entity (Codenamed E-byss)*\n\n\n*The following is a record of the interrogation of Alex Kepler.*\n\nInterrogator(Shortening this to 'I' for the sake of length): Alex Kepler. Age 24. Lived with Mary Cowan.\n\nAlex: Lives. I live with her. Not past tense.\n\nI: But she's gon-\n\nAlex: (Tense posture and language) I'm going to find her.\n\nI: We'll see Mr. Kepler. Could you please start at the beginning of when Ms. Cowan and yourself started having encounters with th-\n\nAlex: The bastard who took her? (Stands up, infuriated. Two operatives walk towards him and he sits back down, sighing to regain composure) Yeah, the beginning. \n\nThing is, it didn't start with us...not initially. People started turning up missing...hah, turning up missing is a funny way to word things. It's like saying you appeared to not appear or some shit.\n\nI: You're getting off topic Mr. Kepler.\n\nAlex: (Throws an annoyed glance at the interrogator before continuing) People were starting to vanish. Kids, adults, old people, one day a person was simply gone. It kinda missed the news I guess. We aren't a huge city or anything though so twenty, thirty people missing wasn't being covered.\n\nI'm ashamed to say that most people in the town took a \"Didn't happen to me so I'm going to look the other way.\" stance.  As long as someone's kid or lover didn't go missing they just sorta carried on as normal, and I was right fucking there with them. I just wanted to work my shitty job, be with my awesome girlfriend, maybe get around to doing something with my life. (Alex slumps down for several minutes in his chair. He doesn't move or say anything)\n\nI: Mr. Kepler. Alex, we need you to continue your story.\n\nAlex: (Deep sigh, rubbing eyes with both hands, he sits back up to continue) Yeah. There were five of us right? My friend group. It was Darren, Lyssa, Oliver, Mary, and me. We were all old high school friends and had yet to move out of town, just five people working, hanging out, living. It really was pretty much like being in high school. We'd all work all day and then meet up at one of our places and spend the rest of the day hanging out. It was nice, maybe naive in a way, but nice. \n\nIt was on one of these nights that the shit storm began. Five of us were over at Darren's place, we were drinking and watching scary movies. Darren had just broken up with his she-bitch and celebrations were had. Anyway, I remember looking over and seeing Lyssa just staring at this photo. Looked like one of those ones that pop out of the bottom of the camera immediately after you take the picture, I don't really remember what those are called. [Pretty sure it's called a Polaroid Camera. Could be wrong. -Secrets] Well she was just staring at this picture intensely. I was sorta amused by the whole thing so I made some funny faces in her direction. She didn't look up from the picture and a minute or so had gone by so I finally chatted her up.\n\n\"Hey Lys, whatcha got there?\" I remember her jumping a little when I spoke, she was a tiny, mousy girl that was always so serious that it was actually almost humorous to me to see her jump like that.\n\n\"Heh, ha, nothing really, I don't think. Hey Darren?\" Darren turned away from the slaughterfest on the screen and turned back to her.\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"I didn't know you had one of those weird cameras.\"\n\n\"I don't own a camera Lyssa, you know I hate having my picture taken.\"\n\n\"Yeah..that's what I thought. Um, could you come look at this?\" Darren got up took a look at the picture and I saw his mouth drop slightly and he looked more than a little disturbed.\n\n\"Yo man, what is it?\" He looked up at me and kinda, shrugged it off I guess, that bit of horror or whatever I had seen was replaced by his usual non-belliever smart guy attitude. \n\nThe photo was a picture of Darren which was weird in itself. Darren hated being in them. Whenever we took a group picture Darren was always the cameraman. Any way the picture was of Darren standing outside at the park in town. He wasn't too far away from the camera, just enough that you could see him from head to toe. Overall he was a pretty average kid. Average height, average build. Glasses, some disheveled hair and his trademark 'Questioning the laws of the universe at all times makes me seem like a better intellectual' face was plastered on.\n\nThis was all fairly normal besides the fact that Darren should never be in a picture. In the background was a tree, it was pretty big probably an oak or maple tree. It was maybe 20 yards behind Darren and there was a figure leaning out from behind the tree. It was also Darren. Sorta. It certainly looked like Darren for the most part but there were some minor differences. No glasses, the shirt had some kind of dark stain on it, his hair was matted down in parts. But what really stood out was the face and hands. His hands were around each side of the tree as he leaned out from behind it and were clearly claws. They weren't just some photo illusion, they were some serious looking claws. This mouth was open in this mischievous looking smile, like the biggest prank ever was about to happen to 'normal' Darren. They eyes were the worst part. Or lack of them I should say. They were definitely just two black circles. The distance was far enough away though that at the time I remember thinking that it could have just been marker or really good pen.\n\nEveryone got a good look of the picture and we all sat there for a few seconds. \n\n\"Well, one of us is good at pranks.\" I remember chiming in to break the silence. We all played it off after that as a prank. Stupid. That was so stupid. I couldn't think of a single way that you could edit one of those photos to add 'Weird\" Darren in the background. On top of that you'd have to initially get the first two pictures of Darren in the first place and that was nigh impossible.\n\nLife went on for about another week. I thought things were normal and everything was fine but looking back on it I can see the signs. Fucking hindsight. The group would meet up except for Darren. We'd give him a call, he said he was sick. That happened three times. And he skipped out on a dinner without telling anyone. We all just assumed that he must seriously be ill so after dinner I went over to his place to check on him while the others went back to Mary and my's house. \n\nThe house was pitch black except for a light coming from his bedroom on the second floor. The door was unlocked so I let myself in. Unsurprisingly, I found him in his room, sitting at his desk. Laid out on the desk were several photos like the one from earlier in the week. I just remember him looking so haunted. He had huge dark circles around his eyes and he definitely hadn't been showering, probably not eating as well. \n\n\"Hey man, what's up?\" I remember asking him so feebly. I was afraid of my own friend.\n\n\"Hey.\" Just one word. He sounded so...defeated, hollow. It wasn't like him at all. \n\n\"What are these? More photos?\" I started leafing through them.\n\n\"Yeah. They keep popping up around me every few hours.\"\n\nThe 'Weird' Darren crept closer to Darren in each frame. It was hunched over in an almost comical sneaking pose. At the end of the series of photos it stepped in to the exact pose that Darren had been in so that the picture was just a picture of 'Weird' Darren from head to toe. Now that he was this close to the camera I could see how off it was. The stains on the clothes were blood. The matted down hair was also from blood I think and the skull looked like it had been cracked open in the back. The hands were definitely clawed although not in quite as an extreme manner as I had thought before. Darren's mouth was twisted up in to a grin, or mockery of one and now I could see that the teeth were pointed and fang-like. And there were no doubts now that these eyes were just blacked out holes. The whole thing almost gave you a sense that it was gloating over the fact that it had taken Darren's place.\n\nI flipped the photo over to see that 'END' had been written on the back of it.\n\n\"You write this Darren?\"\n\n\"No. It was already there.\" I noticed him slump a bit. Darren was crying. The most logical of my friends and 'more often devoid of emotion than not' Darren was sobbing away. There were no words. I didn't say anything, I just...hugged him I guess? Maybe embraced is a better word. He was my friend and he needed me so I was there. I remember asking him if he wanted to come to my place and him refusing bluntly. So I helped him get in bed and told him I'd stay there till he fell asleep and then I'd head back to my place.\n\nHe eventually did fall asleep and I went home. Another mistake. I've made a lot of those recently. I didn't talk to the others about what had happened. I told him he definitely wasn't feeling good and that I was going to go over to his place the next day and stay with him. \n\nThat didn't happen. I messed up so bad. Hell, it's even a fucking horror cliche but part of me wouldn't believe it. Of course when I got to the house he was gone. And of fucking course the room was trashed, serious signs of a scuffle any direction I looked. I lost Darren because I refused to believe in the shit going around me.\n\n(At this point Mr. Kepler breaks down. All attempts to communicate with him fail and he is taken back to his room. The interrogation continues on the next day)\n\nI: Are you ready to continue Alex? Surely you want to help us catch this thing.\n\nAlex: No. I don't want to help you catch it. I want to kill it. I want to kill him.\n\nSo yeah, let's continue then. We filed a report with the police because my friends thought it would help. I still wasn't talking about the photos but I wasn't in denial at this point. My goal was to protect my friends that were left and to catch this thing. I read up on town history, local legends, and even in to the other people missing. Nothing. Two weeks spent being vigilant and intense research and I couldn't come up with anything.\n\nLeft with little options I decided to tell my friends what I knew. Maybe they'd help. Maybe they wouldn't. So when we were all together I dropped everything I knew on them. I mean, it wasn't much but I could tell them about what happened with Darren and the photos. They took it better than I thought they would. Oliver was a little disbelieving but that was just in his nature. Mary seemed to take what I said to heart though. I remember Lyssa just sorta being there. She was always quiet and soft spoken but it seemed strange to me that she'd just have nothing to say. I know I was talking about hindsight earlier but seriously. It seriously kills me that I didn't pick up on this at the time.\n\nLater that night I was woken by a phone call. It was Lyssa. She was sobbing heavily and I could barely understand her. She asked that I come over immediately. I told Mary to stay at home because Lyssa didn't really tell me what was wrong. I remember thinking that if it was whatever took Darren I could get revenge. It wasn't to be though.\n\nLyssa was gone by the time I got to her house. I didn't know if she had been taken or fled so I looked around a bit and I found a pile of photos like the ones Darren had. In the first photo there was a picture of Lyssa from about the waist up and she was staring straight ahead at the camera. I couldn't really make out anything in the background that could be threatening her. Then I looked at her face, she looked scared. I noticed her throat had a bulge in it like something big was lodged in it. In the series of photos she had the bulge worked it's way up and up till she had her cheeks puffed out, sorta like a blowfish. Flipped over to the last photo in the pile and Lyssa's mouth was now wide open, probably about as far as she could manage and the largest, nastiest looking spider I've ever seen was forcing it's way out. I flipped the photo over and once again saw \"END\" written on the back. She had kept this all to herself and pretended it wasn't happening as opposed to Darren who shut himself off from others.\n\nThis didn't set well with the others when I showed them. Oliver actually skipped town. He didn't want anymore to do with this and I honestly think that might have been the right thing. He may be fine now. Not like Mary..\n\n(Mr. Kepler stares off to the side for awhile before continuing)\n\nMary and I were sorta in a haze after that. I lost the will to fight for my two lost friends and Mary just sorta shut off. We stayed this way for maybe a month or so. I did get my will to fight back however, after Mary found her first photograph. \n\nWith her the photo process was even more intimate than the others because she was sharing with me how she felt. Her photo was initially a picture of her standing by a lake. The only off thing about it was a slight pale blue tinge to her skin and lips, almost not noticeable. Her progression was soon made apparent though, the skin turned even more blue. Her eyes glazed over and her body began to bloat. This was Mary if she had drowned and been left in the water. That's when I pieced another piece of this thing together. Mary's worst fear ever was drowning. It was so bad that she sometimes had to be coaxed in to a swimming pool and she never swam in a lake or river. Lyssa was definitely afraid of spiders. I'd seen her hair stand on end just at the sheer mention of them. I wasn't quite sure what Darren's picture represented but I assume it had something to do with him hating getting his picture taken. Our worst fears were being portrayed in these photos. Whatever this was it had an intimate knowledge of us that definitely unsettled me.\n\nMary only got worse as we found more photos. This happened for maybe a week and a half. I had quit work and spent all that time talking to people who were family of or who know other abducted people. Some of them mentioned weird photos and others had no idea what I was talking about. In the end I knew little more when we got the last photo with \"END\" written on the back. \n\nI was around her constantly at that point. I had a baseball bat and a will to protect the love of my life. Mary was the exact opposite. She was giving up and ready to just accept how pointless it all was. The photos or something about them drains you, makes you want to except whatever that unknown end is. But at that point I was feeling anything but giving in. I was angry, I was brave, I was foolish. \n\nThe night it, he, whatever, came to take her I was awake watching over our bedroom as she slept. I had been taking little burst naps during the day so that I could spend all night awake and protecting her. \n\nThere's an eerie feeling when that thing enters your room. It's cold, but not regular cold. It's more like just the sheer absence of heat. \nI pricked up when this happened, grabbing my bat and pacing the room, looking for anything grotesque that I could kill. I pulled a full circle and was surprised at what I did find. A figure was standing over the bed right beside my Mary. It was definitely male, wearing a black hoodie that obscured all of it's face. I think it was wearing baggy jeans or some shit too but I really wasn't just standing there studying the damn thing. I rushed him and took a swing at his head. The intruder caught the bat mid-swing, just stopping my entire attack. I noticed the claw hand from Darren's picture and was then forced in to the wall. Hard. What I saw him do after that was beyond belief for a rational person. But I'm far past rational at this point.\n\nHis body seemed to unzip, not just the hoodie but his entire body. He took his new...wing span? Cloak span? I don't fucking know. But he took both sides of his unzipped body and enveloped Mary. Then the fucker glanced up at me, I still couldn't see his face but I know I caught a smile before they disappeared. \n\nYou guys pretty much know the rest. You found me at the police station after I told my story and rose a ruckus. I've been kept here since. So tell me, that thing wasn't human was it?\n\nI: It's a paranormal or otherworldly entity actually. We believe it stalks and then abducts it's victims to it's home plane of existence. \n\nAlex: Since when do monsters wear a fucking hoodie?\n\nI: You'd be surprised at what we've found them in. Suits, fancy wear, the more intelligent ones do it for reasons we haven't fully discovered. \n\nAlex: And you're keeping me here because?\n\nI: Quite frankly we feel that you're the next target and we want to catch it when you're attacked.\n\n(Mr. Kepler stares off for a while before reaching in to his pocket and pulling out a photograph. He pushes it across the table to the interrogator)\n\nYou've already received your first photo?\n\nAlex: More like my last.\n\nI: But I see nothing wrong with this. It's just a picture of you.\n\n(Mr. Kepler slumps again, a defeated posture)\n\nAlex: That photo used to have Mary and I in it. Each photo I got she was more and more transparent until I was the only one there. My greatest fear was losing her, which ironically has already happened. So if it's all the same to you, let me go. I need to prepare for this thing so I can kill it. Or, it can take me and I'll find her there. Either way, it won't do me any good to be trapped here.\n\nI: I'm sorry Mr. Kepler but you will be staying here. We need to catch this entity and you are now our best lead to do so.\n\n*Alex Kepler was then led back to his cell. Various S-Class detectors and P-Sappers were placed in and around the cell. Unfortunately Subject 653 attempted another breakout and the Non-Paranormal Sector 12 lost power for several minutes. Alex Kepler escaped and was never found again. He is assumed to have been taken by the newly dubbed E-byss.*\n\n*Analysis: This entity has officially been named E-byss by the research staff due to it's connection to Ether and it's manner of abduction. It somehow uses Ether to warp between locations. It is also assumed that it can manipulate Ether to create the various photographs that victims receive. E-byss is definitely highly intelligent. It toys with it's victims and we can only assume it does this to amuse itself. Tests on E-Particles left on the photos and at abduction scenes have led us to be able to track the E-byss and other creatures that dwell in it's plane of existence. Abducted victims seem to be taken to an Ethereal Plane which could harm or kill normal human beings. I strongly suggest we move ahead with The Flint Directive and proceed with The Hysteria Project.*\n\n*It also appear that E-byss has moved locations. We're not exactly sure why. It could be it was hunting something specific in Constance, or it might be because we discovered it's hunting ground and didn't want us so close to it. Regardless, we lack the means to fight E-byss as of now.*\n\n*Case File: Unresolved.*\n\nThe further I read the more I hate Organization 440, though I guess that's a given right? I've started reading Case File Four. It appears to be about The Hysteria Project so at least we'll find out what's going on with that. Might as well go further down the rabbit hole..."

        "body": "All the regular info that is listed on these documents like the date, location, etc., were redacted..so, that obviously won't be written out today. I assume that this takes place in the mid to late 80's as they had talks about The Hysteria Project at the end of Case File 3. I don't know for sure though.\n\n*Doctor Harry Marlowe's Introduction to The Hysteria Project*\n\nThis fine Organization was founded early in our country's history to investigate and combat the paranormal and otherworldly. We tried our best but you can't fight atrocities with mere men. A few projects were headed up back in the 50's and 60's to create a better being, something we could use to fight the unfightable and perhaps even advance America's interests worldwide. They failed miserably. Ethics of the time as well as lack of funding are to be blamed. Under The Flint Directive we have been given the money, resources, and approval to improve upon normal humans or to create some new sort of metahuman in an attempt to protect this fine country. We may not be the only project now underway but we will be the most successful. \n\nThe Hysteria Project is based around the concept of excess emotion and paranormal entities. These entities, which are - in layman's terms - \"Ghosts\", naturally give off various emotions and energy signals associated with the emotion. We believe that we can use this to alter the human physiology and give us a chance at fighting back. We have 120 subjects all together, 60 volunteers, 60...non-volunteers. Half of each group will be subjected to P+(Positive Paranormal Particles) while the other half of each group will be subjected to P-(Negative Paranormal Particles). P+ are positive emotions such as joy and happiness elevated to extreme highs while P- are the exact opposite.\n\nWe have extracted \"matter\"(if you can call it that) to be infused with each subject. Each sample of matter is associated with the emotions of the entity it was taken from. We also plan to use P-Emitters(A retooled version of the P-Sapper) to bombard the subject with the energy and emotions to further stimulate change and progress. This will be done over a period of time that is of right now unspecified, we are making progress in to the unknown and I do not wish to set constraints just yet. Everyone is to read the safety procedures and treatment guidelines on the following page. Should you have any questions please direct them to me after work hours. Also, please stay away from Paranormal Research Bays 1-5, those are for the other projects and are classified. That being said please also be on the lookout for other project members straying in to Bay 6. Our project is just as classified as the others and they are not allowed in here.\n\n*Research notes of Dr. Marlowe: One*\n\n*Note: Dr. Marlowe used these notes to write up the official report for The Hysteria Project but his personal notes are much more inclusive and will be stored in the archives instead.*\n\n22 out of 30 P+ Volunteers remain.\n\n17 out of 30 P+ Non-Volunteers remain.\n\n12 out of 30 P- Volunteers remain.\n\n19 out of 30 P- Non-Volunteers remain.\n\nInitial week of testing has gone by about as well as can be expected. Most of the failed subject's bodies could not contain the introduction of the matter to their system. A few more were lost when we introduced the P-Emitter signal. Those killed by the emitter simply died of brain hemorrhaging and were disposed of while the matter-induced deaths have been a bit more \"fruitful\".\n\nIt seems that the matter we introduced in to their system was capable of killing a body too weak to fight off whatever force it was that was attacking it. I was going to dispose of these bodies but we soon found that the bodies were constantly moving in to new positions and locations in their cells when no one was looking. We checked the surveillance footage of each cell and found that the bodies would indeed get up and move around in quick, jerky movements. The current popular theory among Hysteria is that each corpse is now semi-possessed due to some effect from the matter in their body. If you let the corpse know that you've seen it move it usually stops the dead body charade and you can then attempt to communicate with it. \n\nIt seems that the initial P-Energy decides the mood and temperament of the Mannequin(Unofficial name). Those introduced to positive particles seem to have their face set in a permanent smile/laugh. Their movements aren't fluid at all but there is a sense of zeal or joy in the way they animate themselves. Talking with them is exceedingly difficult as they either talk too fast to be understood or they just speak plain gibberish. When you can communicate with them they act very child-like and appear to want to play \"games\" which we've found out to be extreme acts of aggression and perhaps even murderous intent. \n\nNegative particles produce an entirely different Mannequin. The face of a Negative Mannequin is either very sad and somber or set in to a glare/snarl-like face. Negative Mannequin's personalities are also different on whether they are sad or angry. Both are easy to understand and talk in a slow, rolling manner of speech. Sorrow Negatives move very slowly and fluid, very much akin to a sloth, while Rage Negatives have fast, jerky movements(Although the only time we've observed them moving is when they've tried to attack a researcher or though the surveillance camera where they didn't move much at all). Expectantly the Rage Negatives are bloodthirsty to a fault. Sorrow Negatives are the most rational of the three Mannequins and almost seem to be human. It may be that a larger chunk of the original person's personality is retained.\n\nWe took a Sorrow Negative over to a testing room to see if we could use them. The Mannequin was a young boy, he was an exceptionally frail Non-Volunteer that had been chosen just to see if P-Energy could make him stronger. I was not surprised to find he had died from the matter infusion. It turns out that Mannequins are quite durable. Five pistol shots to the head, impalement, and removal of limbs does not kill or stop a Mannequin. Incineration seems to be the only viable manner of disposing of them as of now.\n\nEach Mannequin also displays certain abilities that I hope will manifest in our living subjects at some point. Positives have started to display above average speed in their movement. This can create a disturbing afterimage effect that they seem to use to demoralizing effect. Rage Negatives have the highest constitution of the Mannequins and can take a great deal of punishment before their bodies start to lose effectiveness. Sorrow Negatives appear to work on a psychological level. They seem to be able to induce suicidal thoughts and feelings in to some of the people around them. \n\nMannequins are certainly a happy accident of The Hysteria Project. It may be quite possible to create a harness or means of control. However, we are are tasked with creating living subjects so the Mannequins are to be moved to another branch to be utilized by a future project.\n\n*Research notes of Dr. Marlowe: Two*\n\nNo further casualties.\n\nWe've upped the P-Emitters as well as added direct exposure of an entity to each subject. Several mutations have been noted. A few of the subjects have a dim glow to their eyes, not sure what it will produce however. A couple of others are showing growth in their limbs in a manner much like Subject 653 and Target Omega. I believe there are other changes going on that we can't perceive yet.\n\nIn regards to behavior we've noticed some patterns as well. Positive Volunteers appear to act almost completely normal to before treatments except for the fact that they no longer sleep. We are not sure if they've achieved some metabolic harmony and no longer need sleep or if something is just preventing them from doing so. We will observe this for a while longer before acting.\n\nPositive Non-Volunteers act similar to the Positive Mannequins, they are overly giddy and are starting to show signs of homicidal intentions. I've had low-grade tranquilizers added to their medicinal cocktails to keep them from suddenly lashing out. We've also found them in corners whispering to themselves.\n\nAlmost every Negative Volunteer has degraded in to a zombie like state. It's getting to the point where we have to feed and clothe them. The few that aren't zombies act rather normal.\n\nEvery Negative Non-Volunteer has degraded to an animalistic state except for one. We can't communicate with them at all. A shame really but if they show enough signs of enhancement then perhaps they could be controlled like the Mannequins. The one that hasn't become feral has shown signs of increased stamina, agility, and mental capacities. No other changes as of now.\n\n*Research notes of Dr. Marlowe: Three*\n\n2 out of 30 P+ Volunteers remain.\n\n7 out of 30 P+ Non-Volunteers remain.\n\n3 out of 30 P- Volunteers remain.\n\n1 out of 30 P- Non-Volunteers remain.\n\nThings have most certainly progressed, bad and good. One of the Positive Non-Volunteers killed two researcher and escaped the facility. At first we were unsure of how he could pull this off but surveillance cameras show that he had developed the teleportation ability found in several entities. The boy's name is Chris something or other. He was brought here along with three others who are now Mannequins. While annoying this is hardly a set back. \n\nWe may have made mistakes with the Positive Volunteers. We started forcing them to sleep because we noticed that the lack of rest was starting to effect them physically. They all refused to sleep and we were forced to start giving them sedatives. All of them besides twin sisters died in their sleep. When I asked them why everyone else had died they replied that it was because \"The monster can't get us if one of us stays up to guard the other\". Somehow one of them had overcome the sedative long enough to allow the other twin to sleep for several hours, they then switched roles. We're letting them sleep on a rotation now to accommodate this development. The twins do seem to be developing rudimentary psionic powers however.\n\nWe have more Positive Non-Volunteers left than in any other group. All seven of them have undergone physical changes. They have developed elongated arms and their shoulder bones are now tipped with a slight point. Their teeth are also becoming more fang-like. Their odd behavior has only increased but this pales in comparison to their newfound ability. We've found them sitting high up on their cell walls or even on the ceiling. Surveillance just shows them walk right or crawl right up the wall with ease. I can only guess that the P-Energy has somehow given them the ability to alter gravity around themselves.\n\nEvery Negative Volunteer that was in that zombie-like state has died. They didn't come back as Mannequins either which I found to be mildly disappointing. The three that we have left are showing signs of growth in muscle mass, height, and strength though so this group still seems to be successful. All three appear to be perfectly sane although they have become rather closed off/antisocial.\n\nIt appears all of the feral Negative Non-Volunteers died of symptoms that reminded me of rabies. It took several days but each morning we'd inspect their cells and find them covered in a frothy blood. None of them became Mannequins. The lone survivor has truly become a metahuman though. He appears to be perfectly normal, no abnormal growth, no disfiguration, and he is superior to a regular human in every way. I have high hopes for what he'll be able to do for the Organization. I only hope that his status as a Non-Volunteer doesn't get in the way.\n\n*Research notes of Dr. Marlowe: Four*\n\nNo further casualties.\n\nIt's been 8 months since the beginning of The Hysteria Project and we have finally reached the fruits of our labor. It appears that all ability growth and mutations have finally slowed down or stopped entirely so there is now plenty of reason to start Live Testing.\n\nThe twins are the only live subjects to retain the dimly lit eyes. We believe that this allows them to see things we normally can't, perhaps it's a view in to another dimension, or maybe they can see beings invisible to us humans. Their psionic abilities also seem to have progressed but there is one overall hiccup. They can only function in tandem. What they've told us implies that what ever being killed off the rest of the Positive Volunteers can kill them if one of them uses their powers without the other twin. At least we now know the proper subjects to gather to recreate this power set. \n\nPositive Non-Volunteers have become truly interesting creatures. Their final mutation is much like the very beings we are hoping to combat. The shoulder blades of each subject have jutted out in definite points. Their arms are now almost identical to Subject 653's. More extreme mutations have occurred as well. All body hair has fallen out and they are now entirely bald. The head of each subject has also elongated in to an almost cone shape and their mouths now extend to each ear. A second row of pointed teeth has also grown in on both the top and bottom of the mouth. The most remarkable mutation is the second set of arms however. The arms grow out of the back, slightly above the kidneys and grow outward, they are elongated and end with well developed claws that the original set of arms lack. It seems that a lot of the bone matter used to fuel this growth was taken from the lower ribcage so the skin and muscles in that area has hardened more than the rest of the body to compensate. Positive Non-Vounteers have been hard to peg down intelligence-wise however. We can no longer communicate with them but it appears they possess an animal cunning to replace it. Perhaps we will test them with basic puzzles or step up surveillance on them, but I'm truly excited for their Live Testing segment.\n\nThe three Negative Volunteers have capped physical growth at slightly over 8 feet tall. They've lost all body hair like the Positive Non-Volunteers. They have gained a remarkable healing factor however and their bodies will push out a bullet and repair the wound in mere minutes. They keep up an emotional wall at all times but they are still quite willing to cooperate. \n\nThe sole Negative Non-Volunteer continues to be the pinnacle of this project. He can beat every researcher here in a game of chess with ease, has aced every intelligence test we've thrown at him, and is physically superior to humans. While initially worried that he'd be angry at us due to his Non-Volunteer status he is actually quite thankful that he's been transformed. I'm not entirely willing to believe that just yet but there's not much more we can do besides keeping an eye on him.\n\n*Live Testing Sequence*\n\n\nThe Live Testing Sequences put a subject(two in the twins case) in a large, yet contained room with simulated debris, light levels, and other variables to simulate an actual encounter zone. Subjects will be pit against U.S. Special Forces/Mercenaries/and various other people with combat training who have been told that they are performing a live fire drill, with no other knowledge of what they will be experiencing. \n\n\n*Subject One: Positive Volunteers*\n\n\nTwo soldiers are introduced in to the environment with the twins already in place. The soldiers creep through the debris, clearly attempting to remain hidden from the danger they were not told about. That stopped when they saw the twins. Both men lowered their weapons and came out of hiding which was a fatal mistake. The first soldier was torn apart from the inside out by a psionic hurricane created within his body. The remaining soldier fired a few shots but they were deftly deflected by one twin while the other killed the soldier in a manner similar to the first. \n\nThis brought up questions about how much punishment their psionic barriers could absorb. Everything from shotguns to grenades to anti-matter rifles have been tested and the twins can absorb all of it, although both of them had to simultaneously deflect some of the heavier firepower.\n\n*Subject Two: Positive Non-Volunteers*\n\n\nOne subject is placed in the environment with one soldier. The subject quickly zones in on to the soldier's location despite the fact that he is hidden. Subject uses walls and ceiling for cover and proceeds to follow and \"toy\" with the soldier for one hour and fifty-three minutes before finally pouncing on him and tearing his limbs off with the clawed arms and choking him with the original arms. Subject then feasted on the corpse before various gasses were introduced in to the room to incapacitate it. Several more tests were held introducing more soldiers in to the environment while maintaining one subject. In these circumstances the subject bides it's time and slowly picks off soldiers one at a time, often falling from the ceiling to make an attack and retreating just as quickly. Every time there was one soldier left the subject would take it's time before finally making the kill.\n\nSubjects seem to take a cat-like approach to their targets. One subject batted a man around for several minutes before retreating again to watch him some more. Other subjects have baited the men in to looking one way only to appear from another direction and not attack. It appears subjects enjoy demoralizing targets. Clawed arms are mainly used for maiming while the regular arms for holding, grasping, or strangling. This is also the first time we've seen them demonstrate their pouncing ability.\n\n*Subject Three: Negative Volunteers*\n\n\nAll three Negative Volunteer tests progressed in the same manner. The soldier/soldiers would enter the room and assume cover to scout out the area. The subject would lumber up to them, taking fire the whole time. Subject reaches the soldier/soldiers and proceeds to smash them or rip them apart with bare hands. Their wounds heal several minutes later and they appear unscathed. The Negative Volunteers requested weapons and a larger group of soldiers to test them. Various bladed and blunt weapons were provided and upped the subject's efficiency, even against larger groups of soldiers. \n\n*Subject Four: Negative Non-Volunteer*\n\n\nInitially the test was to have the subject pitted against one soldier but he requested several more soldiers be added to his test. This request was granted. Eight soldiers were introduced in to the environment. The subject approached them like he was another part of the \"test\" and convinced them that there was another, unseen threat in the area. Subject then used powers we were not formerly aware of. He would get close to a soldier and his eyes rolled back in to his head momentarily while whispering something in to the soldier's ear, the soldier would then turn and shoot a fellow soldier leading to him being shot by the remaining soldiers for the \"unexplained murder\". Subject did this several times to whittle down their numbers, all the while telling them of the horror in the room with them. When there were three soldiers left the subject snapped two of their necks before approaching the remaining soldier and whispering in his ear. The subject then walked away from the soldier, who was staring at his gun, to return to his holding cell. The soldier eventually put the gun to their head and killed themselves due to whatever power of suggestion the subject has.\n\n\n\n*Research notes of Dr. Marlowe: Five*\n\nI've just met with some of the higher-ups in the Organization, my project is not only the first to produce results but also looks to be the only project other than The Architect Project to produce usable subjects. I've gained a lot of credibility due to this and will be given rights to even more ambitious projects in the future. That being said I need to review the attributes and abilities of the subjects that my work has made.\n\n\n\n*Dossiers for Subject Groups One-Four*\n\n\n\n\nGroup Name: Subject One\n\nExperimentation Type: Positive Volunteers\n\nSubjects Survived: Two\n\nNames: Redacted\n\nAge: 13(Both)\n\nHistory: Both of the girls joined the project willingly after their parents were caught smuggling secrets out of the Organization to sell to other countries. The deal was that if they participated in the project then their parents would be spared, they are now being used to keep the twins from rebelling.\n\nPowers/Abilities: Psionic powers, both offensive and defensive. Enhanced vision, possibly in to other realms.\n\nOp Name: Aegis 1 and Aegis 2\n\nAdditional Info: Both girls talk about a figure or entity that will kill them if they sleep or use their powers alone. This means that Aegis 1 and 2 can only be used as a team instead of as separate agents. \n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nGroup Name: Subject Two\n\nExperimentation Type: Positive Non-Volunteers\n\nSubjects Survived: Seven\n\nNames: Redacted\n\nAge: Various, ranging from 19-37\n\nHistory: All Non-Volunteers were taken from various sources including homeless shelters, mental institutes, prisons, and a few kidnappings. All subjects are now roughly equal in appearance regardless of original age, sex, and race. \n\nPowers/Abilities: Extreme mutations. Extra set of clawed arms as well as elongated original arms. Enhanced jaw and teeth. Ability to climb and stick to walls and ceilings. Impressive leaping power.\n\nOp Name: Stalkers\n\nAdditional Info: Stalkers have been named after their desire to stalk and toy with their target before killing them. Stalkers also appear to be completely feral so a means of control needs to be created or they need to be utilized in situations where civilian losses are acceptable. Also, it is unknown if the one subject that escaped will become a Stalker, he possessed a teleportation power not found in the others.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nGroup Name: Subject Three\n\nExperimentation Type: Negative Volunteers\n\nSubjects Survived: Three\n\nNames: Redacted\n\nAge: 27, 31, 39\n\nHistory: All three subjects were previous Organization agents who volunteered for the project to advance our agenda.\n\nPowers/Abilities: Enhanced height and muscle mass. Effective Healing Factor.\n\nOp Name: Titan 1, Titan 2, and Titan 3\n\nAdditional Info: All three Titans have displayed a willingness and desire to use weapons, both melee and ranged, to complete goals. Loyalty to Organization can still be confirmed.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nGroup Name: Subject Four\n\nExperimentation Type: Negative Non-Volunteers\n\nSubjects Survived: One\n\nNames: Redacted\n\nAge: Redacted\n\nHistory: The surviving subject was taken from his home due to an unusual blood-type that we wanted to see if P-Energy could fuse with.\n\nPowers/Abilities: Enhanced intelligence, strength, and speed. Power of persuasion. \n\nOp Name: Savant\n\nAdditional Info: Savant is the metahuman that the project was hoping to create from the start. It is surprising that it came from the Negative Non-Volunteer group but the unusual blood-type may be to blame. Savant is to be watched carefully for any signs of rebelling.\n\n\n*Closing notes of Dr. Marlowe*\n\nI've created, including the Mannequins, seven new types of beings to be utilized by Organization 440 in their endeavors. I consider The Hysteria Project a giant success. The beings and creatures are to be transferred to the Current Ops Branch for further conditioning and assignments. I've also just gotten word that The Architect Project was the only other successful project and they only managed to create one creature. Laughable, truly laughable. I'll be taking a several month break I think, a well deserved vacation while I wait for instructions on the next project.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\nAnd that's where it ends. Secrets here again by the way. I figured that I'd take this space to address a few things and even just provide everyone with more insight into the situation.\n\nFirst off, a few people have been asking me why I don't share the folder, here's a direct quote of mine from Case File One:\n\n\"This may not be the coolest thing to say but I think I'm holding on to these. My first reason is reasonable I think: I really don't know what or who I'm dealing with. If I get in trouble for sharing these then I want to be the only one in trouble, not endanger my favorite subreddit this side of the Ethereal Plane. My second reason is a little less noble..I have something that literally(That I know of) no one else has. Every horror buff and cryptozoologist would kill to get their hands on what I now have. I'm like the kid who got the new Pokemon game a year before everyone else. I mean, if shit gets bad or if I feel I could lose the information I may do a mass upload but as of right now I'm holding the keys to the kingdom. I am sorry and hope you understand.\"\n\nI later followed this up by revealing that I was actually experiencing weird things with the file:\n\n\"A few people have asked me how many Case Files there are and I never give a straight up exact answer. That's because it keeps changing. The number of Case Files within change to a different amount every time I exit and enter it. On top of that, I've noticed Case Files being moved around. It's not the easiest thing to pick up since the Case Files don't have unique names but regardless I've seen the change in order. And on top of all that I can't help but notice that the order of the Case Files seems deliberate so far.\"\n\nSeveral people speculated that someone or something could be moving the files around on purpose, that it may use some kind of archival system not seen in civilian devices yet, or even that the only reason I had this file to begin with is to reveal it to you guys so that the Organization can get a gauge on our reactions to their actions. Dunno. Not enough info quite yet. I've disconnected the laptop that the file is located on to see if someone was using the internet to alter it.\n\nThat being said, I've had some seriously good conversations with a bunch of you in the comments. If you're just checking these out or if you've been here from the start and haven't been reading comments I advise you to think about it. I offer a lot of my personal opinion in the comments section as well as engage in speculation along with everyone else. It's refreshing to get other people's takes on these Case Files.\n\nAnother thing to mention is that the files themselves are not words of text. They are photographs of written documents. The handwriting on these can get pretty hard to read and it takes time to upload. Also, if you find doubled words, spelling mistakes, things like 'me using effect instead of affect' it's because I'm also usually preoccupied with something while typing these whether it be music, video games, or a movie. More than once I have found myself slipping in a lyric that I had just heard simply because I wasn't paying attention. So, I apologize for that in advance, I plan to slowly go through these and edit my grammar mistakes.\n\nOh, and before I forget. One of the Case Files appears to be titled Hoffer. I've mentioned that in the comments as well and it probably needs to be said in post. The Hoffer file is actually one of the things that made me notice that the files are moving around in the first place.\n\nWith that I bid you a good day NoSleep, I look forward to meeting you in the comments. As always, stay safe."

        "title": "Case File #5 Jack",
        "body": "*Case File: 005-151*\n\n*Case File Date: 08/24/1990*\n\n*Location: London, United Kingdom*\n\n*Subject: Kyle Grant*\n\n*Entity: Jack*\n\n*The following report comes from Mr. Grant's personal journal, found at his apartment.*\n\n08/24/90  Friday  Entry One\n\nMom bought me a journal to keep my thoughts in while I'm living away from home so here goes! My name's Kyle Grant and I'm studying literature abroad in London. This is all so exciting, I never thought I'd leave Ohio let alone the United States. It's a frightening yet truly wonderful experience.\n\nMy apartment building is a little dingy but I don't really mind. I'm on the third floor and can look out at a fair bit of the city. The district of London I'm in is called Whitechapel and I suppose it's a bit lower class but the apartment was cheap and I should be able to commute to school in very little time. There are four separate apartment units on my floor but I think only mine and one other are occupied, I'll have to meet my floor-mate later since we'll probably see each other from time to time anyways.\n\nClasses start monday and I'm excited, no idea what to expect though. Guess I'll finish unpacking and call it a day.\n\n08/25/90  Saturday  Entry Two\n\nExplored Whitechapel a bit today. There's a ton of culture here regardless of the status of the people here. Tons of cool little shops tucked away and a few places that I know I'm going to go eat at. The one thing I didn't like was how...bright my clothes seemed compared to everyone else. There were lots of black, brown, and grey, occasionally a splash of pastel on some of the women. But there I was in bright green, just trudging through the streets.\n\nCame home but didn't meet the other tenant on my floor yet. No biggie, I'll get around to it I'm sure. Time to write, I've been so stressed/excited/curious about my surroundings that I haven't been able to really write like I usually do.\n\n08/26/90  Sunday  Entry Three\n\nDidn't end up writing much last night and I fell asleep at my desk. I was kinda in a haze all day too. I think it's just a combination of anticipation and homesickness. I wrote a letter to Mom that I plan on mailing out in a few days and that made me feel better. Oh, and I met Jack.\n\nI heard his door open with a rather loud creak from my apartment and hurried out to greet him real quick. He was interesting enough at a glance. Pale skin, sharp features, dark eyes, black hair. When he spoke it was with a very faded british accent, like he'd been away from the United Kingdom for many years so it was losing it's touch. He picked up on my American accent and we talked about why I was over here. He mentioned that he had just moved back from the states and that it had been a long time since he had been back to London. A bit strange since Jack doesn't look a day over 25 but maybe he's one of those younger looking people.\n\nClass starts tomorrow morning, excited but I need to sleep now. Hope it's a good day.\n\n08/27/90  Monday  Entry Four\n\nClasses were enjoyable. I got a little bit recognition for being The American of the class and it was kinda nice to be able to tell them about home. Really helped with that homesickness problem I was having too. We shared some of our previous work with everyone else today. A lot of people actually liked my writings, a lot. Guess I really did get in to this school for a reason. I think it's going to be great, life that is.\n\n09/19/90  Wednesday  Entry 27\n\nI met a girl today. I was visiting my favorite little restaurant across the street and she happened to be eating there alone as well. Her name is Jenessa and she is beautiful. Long dark hair...big brown eyes...she caught my eye immediately.\n\nI can't really say how it all came together but we ended up eating together and talking for a few hours. We're going to meet up tomorrow after I have class. \n\nAlso, a lot of noise has been coming from Jack's apartment. It's nothing I can really understand. Just loud noises. I'll have to ask him about it later.\n\n09/24/90  Monday  Entry 32\n\nJenessa and I have kinda became a thing. I guess meeting back for dinner day after day will do that. I found we have a lot of the same interests and she even enjoyed a little bit of my story I wrote back in high school. She was so cute and awkward about asking if we could continue dating regularly and then she just...kissed me. It was sudden and I know she had to have been working up the courage to do that since we met for dinner today.\n\nOn another high note I seem to be around the top of the class. I wasn't bad at school back in the states but I am really applying myself these days and it feels so good. Need to write another letter to Mom she still hasn't replied to my last one.\n\nTalked to Jack about the noises today. I know it's stupid but I swear I saw his eyes tighten or whatever, like when a book describes someone's momentary anger. It was like that but only for a second. I'm going to be cliche and say it was my imagination this time. Anyway, he said the loud noises were his television. He had an older one and the volume liked to jump on it.\n\n09/30/90  Sunday  Entry 38\n\nI swear I heard screaming coming from Jack's apartment today. Women's screaming, and it was loud too. I want to believe it was the television but maybe...nah, I'm sure it's nothing.\n\nJenessa is going to come over in a few days. I'm so excited and nervous at the same time. I really don't have the most...luxurious place around but she's something special. I'm sure it'll be ok.\n\n(The writing here becomes really bad, like Kyle was writing this down quickly. -Secrets)\n\nI'm sitting here defeated, with what may be some of my last moments and I need to write this out. Jenessa is dead. We had an amazing evening together in my apartment. I saw her out and went back up to my room, I could see her walking down the street from my window. Then Jack attacked her. He came out of nowhere and plunged a knife deep in to her abdomen...I could only look on in horror as he cut her from hip bone to hip bone letting some of her...entrails fall to the ground.\n\nI'm writing this out detailed in case I never get the chance to tell the police about this. This is the important part I think. Jack stood over her now lifeless body and something happened to his face I think. He was turned away from me but I think his face jutted forward a bit. Then it opened right down the middle, I know this for a fact because I saw both sides of the face flip backwards and flap in the wind. His eyes, mouth, skin, I even saw muscle.\n\nJack leaned down close to the wound so that he was inches from it and then slowly pressed whatever was now his face to the wound. At that moment something started writhing though Jenessa's body, I could see the mass push at her skin in places and it was making her body twitch. May have been the most unsettling thing I have ever seen. I think it came from Jack's head and it appeared to be systematically searching the inside of her body for something. It found whatever it was because the twitching became full on convulsions and it looked like something was ripped from her body and in to Jack's face. \n\nHe slowly turned around and I saw what his face now was. It was nothingness. It was hollow. It was death. There was a deep black hole replacing the entire face region on Jack. I was beyond feeling terrible at this point, I still do. I didn't and probably couldn't save her.\n\nJack's fell to the ground for a moment and his face flaps fell back over his face. It looked like some sinewy material latched on to both flaps and pulled them together. The face then seemed to fuse back to normal and he looked just like regular Jack again. \n\nI kept watching as Jack grabbed Jenessa's body and slumped out of sight. And I was still watching when he came home several hours later, blood stains still on the leather apron that I had just noticed he had on. I listened the whole time as he trudged down the hallway and in to his room. \n\nNow I'm sitting here lost and very much alone, Jenessa is dead, and my neighbor is both her killer and a monster.\n\n\nOne day since Jenessa's death. I didn't go to school. I didn't go out to eat. I laid here and thought about Jack and Jenessa. The things he did to her. Why did he kill her? Why root around in her body? What is he? I'm not sure if I want to find out.\n\nTwo days since Jenessa's death. I'm not ok. Mentally, physically, or emotionally. I spent all day yesterday lamenting over her death but now I need to figure out what's going on. I need to stop Jack. \n\nThree days since Jenessa's death. I finally left my apartment to go get food. The restaurant is so empty without Jenessa though and it did me no good emotionally to be eating there. I picked up some groceries for home so I wouldn't have to go out. \n\nSaw Jack on my way back up to the apartment. I don't want to say he knows that I know he's a monster but he wouldn't stop staring at me. I was trying to act as casual as I could without being too obvious.\n\nFour days since Jenessa's death. Jack brought a girl back to his apartment today. They seemed to be very flirtatious and she willingly went in to his place. I think she may be the next victim. I need to watch and listen closely.\n\nFive days since Jenessa's death. She still hasn't left the house. Jack has come and gone several times. She may already be dead but I'll keep an eye out.\n\nSix days since Jenessa's death. I heard the screaming again so I slowly crept out of my room and pressed my ear to his door. The sobbing pleas of the girl I could make out were along the lines of \"Why are you doing this?\", \"Stop, just let me go.\", and finally she got terrified and shouted \"What are you, oh my God, what are you?\". I heard a gurgle, a tearing noise, and then this ridiculous slurping noise. And then I made a mistake. I leaned to close to the door and actually pushed it open a slight bit making a loud creaking noise. I saw Jack spin around through the crack in the door and I ran back to my room and locked the door. \n\nHe's cut my phone line. I tried going out the window but I can't drop three stories without dying or severely hurting myself. I can here him at my door tapping at it and calling my name, I know he's going to force his way in soon. All I have to defend myself are a kitchen knife and a wooden plunger that I sharpened the end of with the knife. I'm going to try and stab it through his face, maybe it's a weak spot. Mom, I love you, thanks for always believing in me. Jenessa, this is all my fault. I got you killed and I know it. I'll fight Jack to avenge you and then I don't know...\n\n(The handwriting changes here to a more crude style that is nothing like Kyle's previous handwriting, implying, well, you know."

I only have a while to be here anyway right?\n\nI: We're not entirely sure, that's why we would like to get your story recorded as soon as possible.\n\nMarleen: (Deep sigh) Ok. Yesterday, I think it was yesterday, I was with Miles. Miles is my boyfriend and we've been together for awhile. Well, I started seeing things, weird things.\n\nI: Care to explain exactly what you saw?\n\nMarleen: I'd see a cat and it was transparent, no one could interact with it or see it besides me. I'd see a person and they'd have weird afterimages around them like they were in two places at once or something. It was stuff like that for most of the day. I also started feeling weird things as the day drug on.\n\nI: What kind of feelings?\n\nMarleen: It's not the easiest thing to explain but I would feel like I was being \"tugged\" on periodically, like something was pulling at my very existence. Gravity seemed to get very heavy.\n\nI: Have you felt this sensation since you arrived here?\n\nMarleen: Yeah, a few times now, mainly in the past couple hours.\n\nI: I see. Go on.\n\nMarleen: Well, I tried to go about my day. I figured I could go to the hospital in the morning if it had gotten any worse. I laid down for the night with Miles and woke up in a desert. I ended up wandering it for a day or so before collapsing and passing out. That's when I woke up here. Been here ever since getting questioned and being told I'm not alive.\n\nI: In a manner of speaking. What did the initial scientists and researchers here tell you? We'd like to get the information straight from you on record.\n\nMarleen: (Breaks down in to tears) They told me...they told m-(Has a Dimensional Pull at this point. Ms. Reyes is given several hours to rest before the questioning continues.)\n\nI: Are you feeling better Ms. Reyes? Are you ready to continue?\n\nMarleen: I really am going to leave soon aren't I?\n\nI: Nothing is certain Miss Reyes. Please continue.\n\nMarleen: Right. The doctors. Well, I woke up here in a cell. Immediately after waking some men came in and took me to a lab. I was stripped of my clothes and scanned right there. I can see how that's sorta necessary but I was still scared and confused at the point and wasn't very cooperative. \n\nAfter they took readings and stuff for maybe a little under an hour I was given clothes and they talked to me a bit.\n\nI: What did they say?\n\nMarleen: Just stuff like who I was, questions to confirm my identity, the stuff with the pulls I told you about. They then told me some serious things that I definitely did not believe at first. That I was dead.\n\nI: Not quite.\n\nMarleen: Ok. That the me from this dimension was dead. Hell, even being told that I wasn't in my own world and had somehow crossed dimensions is not an easy thing to believe or cope with.\n\nI: Yes, but it did happen, and it has happened before. You see, we've found that our dimension is extremely close and parallel to another dimension. We call that Earth: Earth-A. You are from Earth-A and were pulled here randomly as many things have been before.\n\nMarleen: Yeah. That's what the doctors said. They also told me that on the morning after I was teleported my boyfriend killed me. He was having an affair or some such and I found out. Well, the Marleen from here found out and he killed her. I didn't believe it at first but I've watched the story on it from the News Channel, read the articles in the newspaper, and even seen the official police report on it. Miles killed me.\n\nI: That is unfortunate, if you do get the chance to return to your Earth what are you going to do?\n\nMarleen: (Angrily) I'm going to kill him.\n\n(At this point the space between Ms. Reyes seems to fold in around itself and she let's out a scream that fades and contorts until it suddenly stops. Ms. Reyes is no longer in the room with the Interrogator.)\n\n*Analysis: Earth-A and our Earth appear to almost be the exact same place. Our scientists think that a significant event in the future will denote the major split in our continuities. We were able to use the readings taken from Ms. Reyes to create a kind of viewing device into Earth-A. This denotes one split from Earth-A that we have. Marleen Reyes returned to her home dimension and immediately killed Miles Barton. She was then given the death sentence and killed some time later. This mirrors what happened to Miles in our Earth. In the end both Miles and Marleen have died. We will keep watching to see how big a difference this has caused on each Earth. Scientists are looking for a way to travel to and from Earth-A at will.*\n\n*Case File: Pending.*\n\nWasn't exactly expecting something like this. It was a bit shorter than the other Case Files but I feel it has given me a bit to think about. The date also gives me pause. 2007 wasn't that long ago. So, stay safe No Sleep."

It goes on to talk about him being stalked by this monster and then eventually being killed by it. Thing is, our town has no legend, there is no Lightning Man, and my brother isn't dead. Certain parts of his story do match life though. He had just moved in to a new house on the edge of town and his description of the house is spot on.\n\nAfter writing this note Randy went in to a coma and was taken to a hospital on the other side of town. For a few weeks I just accepted it like everyone else but then I started seeing things too, short flashes of vivid images and then those turned to watching whole events unfold.\n\nIn these 'visions' I saw life as if Randy had actually died. I experienced loss, I grieved, I learned to live without him. It was actually eerily similar to how I was feeling with him currently. With him in a coma I had been grieving and feeling loss. It was then that I decided to actually investigate this whole thing and see what was up with this hospital. We already had a main hospital in the center of the town and it seemed to be more than adequate to be of service to the city, plus we had several private practitioners of medicine that catered to the older folks around town. Why build another one and put it a bit out of the way? That sorta screamed fishy to me.\n\nLocal records did not have much to say. On the outside it was just United Birming General Hospital, a weird name as well. Almost gave off the sound of a church to me, you know, minus that General Hospital bit. So I had to ask around, turns out that the hospital was actually a bit of a folk tale with the kids and teenagers now. Apparently people around town were going in to comas and then they'd be taken to this hospital and were basically never seen again. There were variations of it and such but it all shook out the same. People in the 20-30 year old range knew next to nothing about the place like myself. Anyone older than that would not talk to me about it at all or were extremely hostile to me. I actually had some police officers come to my house and ask me to stop \"stirring up the community\" and that they were going to let me go with a warning because of my \"recent loss\". \n\nI had exhausted all other options so I could either give up and be done with this whole thing, or I could attempt to sneak in to United Birming. I honestly think I would've quit there but my visions were getting worse. I was now acting extremely paranoid and was locking myself in my house for long periods of time. I think days or maybe weeks straight before I'd come out again, and I started seeing The Lightning Man haunting me. I'd look out a window and see these glowing eyes peering in, it was truly horrible. I was getting the feeling that when he caught me in my visions I would probably go in to a coma too so doing nothing was never an option. \n\nI took a few days to look the place over really well. It didn't have huge walls or tons of security or anything. I noticed one security guard on the premise at all times and doctors going in and out all day with a couple staying through the night. From which rooms still had lights on at night I deduced that they must stay in one section of the hospital all night with the guard doing general rounds every few hours. \n\nMy plan was to go in at night, the windows weren't fastened all that well and some doctor's left them them cracked due to the heat. I'd just have to pop out the screen and slip in to the building on the side that the doctor's didn't stay at. After that I'd just search the building, see what I could find.\n\nI got in without a problem and found myself in an office. I kinda searched it a bit but most of the documents I found were just budget reports. I noticed they were getting a huge amount of cash from some organization, probably a government branch or something. I left that room and found myself in a huge hallway. None of the room names really caught my interest until I passed a hall that said 'Patients P-T'. I thought that Randy was probably in there and I wanted to see him. Plus I wanted to know what they were doing with the patients that they kept here.\n\nI ended up in a surprisingly large room filled with beds and machines. Each patient appeared to have a gas mask-like thing over their heads with hoses going to the mouth and wires to the back of the neck. I eventually found Randy. I kinda broke down for a minute or two just seeing him like that. We were actually close siblings and it hurt to see my little brother look more machine than man. I couldn't even see his face.\n\nThere was a clipboard attached to his bed so I picked it up and scanned through it. There was a lot of information that I didn't even begin to comprehend like medical dosages and other medical jargon. A few pages back I started finding stuff that actually related to Randy's notes and experiences with The Lightning Man.\n\nI think this is a good time to mention that I never actually told anyone that I'd read Randy's notes. I was the one that had went over to his house to find him in a coma and I noticed the notes in the other room after I had called 911 and perused them. I set them down and had never mentioned them again. At the time I was too stricken with grief to even think about them. From what I was piecing together I think I would've been in a lot more trouble if these people knew I had read the notes at that time.\n\nThe clipboard kept mentioning something called a \"Converging Point\" and \"Dimensional Bleeding\". The way the paper kept using the terms I think that the doctor's thought that something extra-dimensional or something was the cause of Randy's coma. The \"Dimensional Bleeding\" could've been the visions I was getting. So does that mean that the events with The Lightning Man were occurring in another dimension? And the \"Converging Point\" could be the moment you fall in to a coma, when The Lightning Man kills you. I don't know if it has any truth to it but that's what I got out of the reports. I scanned around the room at the various other patients and noticed that I knew several people there. They were people that I was certain had gone off to college and settled down elsewhere. Their families never let on that anything had ever happened to them. \n\nAt that point I heard steps coming my way and I ducked under one of the beds. Several minutes passed and no one actually came in to the room but it was enough that it had spooked me. I ended up sneaking back out the way I came and went home to have a restless night of sleep. \n\nThe next day I went over to the parent's house of one of the girls I had seen in the patient room. She was a year or so older than me and last I knew she was off at college still to become a doctor. Her dad answered the door and I immediately brought up his daughter. He mood changed instantly and he told me to leave and was starting to close the door when I told him I had seen her in the hospital last night and asked him why everyone thought she was off at college still. He opened the door back up and his mood had changed again. He looked both scared and beaten and made me promise to never repeat what he was about to tell me to anyone else. His daughter had gone off to school for awhile like I thought but while she was away she had slipped in to a coma. The doctor's at United Birming offered the man and his family a large sum of money if they let her stay at their hospital and acted like she was still away at college. He said that he suspected that his family wasn't the first one to get a deal like this and that I shouldn't ask too many more questions in case it got dangerous for his family or myself. I said my goodbyes and sorta just tranced though my next few days just trying to get a grasp on reality.\n\nThen I ended up having another vision, in this vision The Lightning Man made it's way in to my house and actually attacked me. I struggled to run away but in the end it touched me and sent currents of electricity through my body. I felt myself losing consciousness as the pain coursed through my body and then I woke up. I woke up with a mask strapped around my face feeding me terrible tasting liquids and oxygen. I was in the hospital. \n\nI panicked and struggled to pull the mask off. It caught on the wires that were now embedded in the back of my neck and caused me even more pain. I stopped freaking out and slowly pulled the wires straight out. It hurt but I was pretty sure it wasn't doing any permanent damage to me. After they were out I slowly unfastened the mask and removed the tubes from my mouth. They were actually fed down my throat a good deal and I started gagging as I removed them. With my eyes not unhindered by the mask I noticed I was in the patient room again, in a bed next to my brother. I had actually lucked out, it was night and there was no one around to see me freaking out, or so I had thought. Turns out the machine I had been attached to was freaking out and sending out alarms. I waited behind the door until several doctors got close to it and pushed it open hard. I'm pretty sure I broke the closer doctor's nose and the second one was too focused on his colleague to follow me. \n\nI managed to make it back to that office I had snuck in previously and used that window to escape. Paranoia set in so instead of trekking back to my house I slowly snuck through town to my parent's house. They were surprised and scared to see me. Apparently I had gone in to a coma myself about two weeks ago. I was shocked and upset to find out I had been out for two weeks and even more shocked to be awake again. I remember The Lightning Man touching me in that last vision. My parents told me that they'd been bribed to keep it quiet that I had gone in to a coma and that they had received money from United Birming. I had them sit down and told them everything I knew at that point. Pretty much everything that I am telling you now. My dad kinda sat there in thought for a bit and then told me that I could hide out with them for the next several days. He had a few friends that he could call that he thought could help. Those friends directed him to a government group that specialized in stuff like this and so here I am. \n\nThe only other information I can give you is that my visions have started up again. I think that The Lightning Man didn't end up killing me but the contact from him made the vision me pass out which led to my short term coma. But he's getting close to me. I think I only have another vision or two before he catches me and then I'll probably fall in to a coma again. So, you can help me right?\n\n*The interrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr33408432&*(T(DWD(*& Sm111i1i1irh.*\n\n*T's Memo: I wasn't planning on contacting you this soon but it is what it is. You shouldn't be attacked again, I'll make sure of that. You just focus on getting these out. I'll be in touch soon.*\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\nSo. Apparently it's been awhile right? A month or so. I think three weeks since I've actually replied to anything on here. Well, let's go over this then: I mentioned several times that I was going to be working my days and a coworkers days for a week, which ended up turning in to two weeks. So initially that stopped me from being on NoSleep. But, something happened...I got amnesia'd hard or something. But it wasn't like JRPG protagonist amnesia. I only lost my memories when it came to NoSleep, the Case Files, and Reddit in general, and whatever event it is that caused me to forget in the first place. \n\nWell, today I got on my computer to see this...Case File(?) in a word document on my desktop and I read through it. It sorta jogged some memories but not at the same time. It was like I remembered that I had forgotten something. So I sat on it for a few hours and then I looked at the weird title which is definitely THE LIGHTNING MAN in caps slipped in to the phrase 'echoes of another dimension'. Seeing The Lightning Man jogged some more memories and I got on reddit to see that I had an account on here. At the time I didn't remember even having an account so I looked at the posts that I had made and read through all the Case Files. Took me a little longer but eventually I pieced together my memories. Well, I checked my laptop that I was storing the Case Files on and it had nothing on it. I wasn't going to post anything and was planning on just letting this go. I mean, it would have been pointless to post on here that I had been attacked and lost the Case Files. You guys could forget about me and I'd be safe. \n\nWell, nope. I had gone out to get groceries and when I got home there was a flashdrive plugged into my computer with the Archive window open. So, here I am. I'll at least write out the next Case File while I'm figuring out what to do. Sorry for any alarm or anger I may have caused. I definitely never meant it. Stay safe NoSleep."

        "title": "Case File #7 The Hastings Incident",
        "body": "*Case File: 007-867*\n\n*Case File Date: 11/3/2009*\n\n*Location: Zone 7, Redacted*\n\n*Subject: Zone 7, Argus Hastings*\n\n*Entity: Stalker, Target Omega*\n\n\n*Mission Briefing*\n\nArgus Hastings has worked with Organization 440 for many years contributing to our operations, projects, and generally advancing our interests. We have now found out that Hastings has defected and is planning to give a large portion of our work as well as facility locations to Zone 7. We cannot allow this. Agents are to covertly lock down Zone 7 and insert a Stalker to kill all inside. Collect Zone 7's data and sabotage the facility after Stalker has cleared it. \n\n*Mission Synopsis*\n\n*Most information of the mission was taken from Zone 7's surveillance cameras post-mission. Almost all dialogue has been translated from it's original language for ease of reading.*\n\n11/3/2009  0400\n\nAgents Chan and Weles infiltrate the perimeter of Zone 7 through the use of superior tech. The outside guards are dispatched through various discrete means including silenced firearms, hand to hand combat, and bladed weapons.\n\n0430\n\nEntire perimeter of Zone 7 is secured. Agent Chan hacks and systematically locks down Zone 7 while Agent Weles calls in Stalker's transport.\n\n0445 \n\nThe Stalker is successfully inserted in to Zone 7 via the ventilation shafts. Agents seal up the shaft immediately to prevent Stalker from escaping and then proceed to secure any other exit Stalker may find. \n\n0450\n\nThe Stalker finds it's first victims in the engineering bay. The engineers had been trying to breach the main exit door with various tools when the Stalker made itself known with a loud shriek while staying in the darkness. Of the five engineers in the room three of them fan out over the large area with their tools as weapons. The other two engineers attempt to open the door.\n\nThe engineer on the far right is attacked first. The Stalker jumps down right behind him before leaping back up with both claws pressing in to his back. The force of the leap pushed the Stalker's claws through the Engineer's back and out through his ribcage. The Stalker disappears in to the shadows among the ceiling with the body of the engineer as the other two engineers investigate the noise. \n\nThe Stalker tosses the engineer at the two others and hits one of them, breaking the tossed engineers body and knocking the engineer down. The standing engineer raises his torch up near him in a defensive stance. The stalker lands to the right of him and tears his head off with one swipe of a clawed arm (Note: Researchers idea to sharpen claws on Stalkers proves to be a smart choice.). The Stalker ambles over to the downed engineer and snaps his neck with little hesitation before returning to the darkness around the ceiling.\n\nThe remaining engineers working on opening the door call out to their comrades before setting back to the door once more. The Stalker lets a few cries out around the room to unnerve them. It then throws several chunks of the deceased engineers close to the two men in an effort to spook them further. The engineers panic and turn their back on the Stalker to open the door quicker. The Stalker takes this opportunity to land behind them and attack. The engineer on the left is grabbed by the Stalker and slammed several times in to the wall. The other engineer turns his torch on the Stalker but the Stalker swiftly breaks the man's hand with it's spare hands and turns the torch upon him, burning him to death.\n\n0525\n\nEveryone in Engineering is dead and the Stalker detects other people in the facility, using the air ducts to travel around.\n\nHastings is in the main research bay, visibly shaken.\n\n0530\n\nThe Stalker gains access to the main hallway system and disposes of the several employees and guards trapped in there.\n\n0540\n\nThe head of security(trapped in the Security Surveillance Room) notices the Stalker on camera(Agents had shut down most cameras but several were still working at this point) and alerts the rest of the facility via intercom. \n\n*Transcribed copy of the warning.*\n\nUnidentified, physical entity is loose in the facility, we have confirmed casualties. Please block the vent entrances in your rooms and any other entrances that the entity could use to enter. Also, it appears that most of our facility is suffering from technical difficulties. Doors are not working, computers and phones are down. This may be an act of sabotage.\n\nHastings is hiding in the corner of the research bay and is writing in a notebook.\n\n0550\n\nThe Stalker sniffs out three researchers hiding in a lab and starts prying the metal doors open. One researcher runs to a computer console and starts typing furiously.\n\n*The Researcher's Message*\n\nWe're under attack. It must be because of that defector that arrived yesterday. I knew letting him in here was a bad idea, should've taken him to corporate or some place public. Organization 440 is just too strong and advanced right now to be opposed. Luckily most of our research has been moved to Zone 2 due to our new agreement. It's a cold relief that they won't get their hands on my work. ______ , this message may never get to you but I love you so much. I am sorry I never told you about my work. Please raise our son to be-\n\nThe Stalker bends the doors back and lunges at the closest researcher, tearing him clean in half. The other two researchers attempt to hide in the back of the lab but the Stalker forcibly removes them from their hiding places and strangles each of them before moving back through the hallways.\n\n0630\n\nFour rooms remain with people in them. Security Surveillance Room, Main Research Bay, Recreation, and Test Room Two. The several guards in Security are trying to find a way out of the room and have been banging and pulling on the doors, chipping at the reinforced glass, and trying to get the facility's systems back online. \n\nThe group in Main Research Bay are rapidly sealing off portions of the room and making barricades. A few of them have noticed a ventilation shaft and are attempting to create a makeshift ladder to seal it off. Hastings is still in the corner of the room writing.\n\nRecreation appears to be one of the areas that wasn't locked down. The group inside is split between trying to escape and bordering up the room to hold out for rescue.\n\nThe several people in Test Room Two are panicking more than the other groups. It appears that they've been trapped in the middle of an experiment and the entity that was the focus of the experiment is breaking out of captivity. \n\n0650\n\nThe cameras for Test Room Two goes out at this point.\n\nThe Recreation group is split nearly in half. Five of them want to make a break for it while the other four want to barricade. The Stalker throws open the doors and pounces on the nearest two people, ripping at them with claws and gouging out eyes. Four people make it out of the room, two people run further back in to Recreation to hide, and one person is gutted while trying to save one of the researchers from the Stalker.\n\n0655\n\nThe Stalker roots out the two hiding researchers in Recreation and rips them limb from limb. (Researchers repeated desire to hide from the Stalker is ineffective. The Stalker's keen senses prove to be too much.) It begins feasting on the corpses in the room.\n\n0700\n\nThe four researchers continue to flee through the hallways, trying various doors as they go and navigating around previous victims of the Stalker.\n\n0705\n\nTwo of the researchers stop at the Security window and pound on it while the other two continue on towards the main exit.\n\nStatic and screams pour from Test Room Two's microphone. The screams appear to be a mix of the researchers in the room and the entity they were researching.\n\n0720\n\nThe Stalker finishes eating. (A Stalker can burn through an immense amount of energy if constantly attacking and moving. They are prone to taking breaks to feast on prior victims to regain energy.) It lumbers out in to the hallway and starts making it's way towards the Main Research Bay.\n\nThe two researchers at Security get in to a brief discussion about where to go next. One wants to check on Test Room Two to make sure their failsafes did not go down while the other wants to head towards the exit. They debate for several minutes before splitting up.\n\n0730\n\nThe Stalker reaches the Main Research Bay and begins pounding and tapping on the various doors, testing their strength. Several of the people inside grab desks and various other large objects and start barricading the doors on that side of the room.\n\nThe researcher reaches the entrance to Test Room Two and is visibly shaken. He screams several times at the door before falling backwards and resting against the wall.\n\nThe screams stop emitting from Test Room Two.\n\nEveryone in the Main Research Lab stops doing what action they were doing prior and seem to be listening for or to something. \n\nHastings makes a mad dash for the leg space under one of the desks and curls up there.\n\n0731\n\nThe Stalker lets out a shriek.\n\nThe door to Test Room Two suddenly opens despite the lack of power to it. The camera pointed at Test Room Two's door from the hallway starts to flicker and a large mass of...matter writhes out in to the hallway and envelopes the researcher slumped against the wall. (The camera is filled with static and interference making the visibility of this event poor.)\n\n0732\n\nEvery camera in the facility suddenly goes off. There is no audio or video.\n\n0740\n\nEvery camera turns on again. Each room is filled with horrific sights, the only movement seen when the cameras turn back on is  someone already halfway out the main entrance door. They leave through the door and it closes behind them but Chan and Weles report no one coming out that door and the exterior camera does not show the door opening nor anybody leaving the building.\n\n0900\n\nA team is sent in to investigate the building and find Hastings. They find pages of his notebook in the entranceway to the facility.\n\n*Hasting's Notebook*\n\nThe facility has just locked down, trapping us in Research. I assume this means that Organization 440 has come to reclaim me or at least deny me from helping anyone else. I'll know when I figure out which Operative has been sent. \n\nI didn't really betray Organization 440, not in a malicious way or anything. I found someone else who has something that you didn't have and decided that my talents would be of use. In the end working here and with these people would benefit all humankind in their constant battle against the strange and paranormal.\n\nI admit that I was going to have to release some information that would compromise a few locations and probably get a few of the Organization's labs destroyed. That was an unfortunate side effect of gaining their trust. They wouldn't let me work on the project unless they were sure I wasn't a mole.\n\nNow we need to get to the reason I'm writing this message, why I'd be writing a message to the people that might be trying to kill me. If you do succeed in killing me then you'll still need guidance. I still have people I care about out in the world so I will put aside my petty feelings to make sure what needs to be done gets done.\n\nThey found and captured Target Omega. I have no idea exactly when or how they did it. Technically they shouldn't have been able to. While every secret paranormal organization across the world has access to really good tech that is easily above what the public use Zone 7 still wasn't particularly high on the power list.\n\nThey won't tell me specifics but I believe that Target Omega was caught in a hibernating state of some kind within this country. It worries me more than a little, stumbling across one of the most powerful entities in our plane of existence and they've only encountered it while it's sleeping. There's something to be said when you don't earn your entity. \n\nSo now you know why I defected. If I had instead told the Organization about Omega then a raid on the lab would've been inevitable, there was a high chance that Omega would awaken and be lost. I couldn't let that happen, so I did what I did. Unfortunately, the attack happened regardless and I can only hope nothing happens beyond the loss of the research staff here.\n\nAn announcement about keeping vents closed just went off. A Stalker? You do intend to kill me. \n\nThis is all I know about Target Omega: It is an entity both like an unlike other creatures we've faced before. It has the 'standard' plane jumping power associated with many otherworldly entities, psionic powers the likes I've never seen, and apparently the ability to manipulate matter. This thing is Deity-like in every way, more so than trapped Gods like Volos.\n\nIt's most impressive and erratic ability seems to be entirely unique to it however. It's a shapeshifter but not like the ones we've seen before. Omega seems to be in almost constant flux changing from one thing to the next. There is a catch to this however, if someone is looking at Omega it can not or will not change shape. Cameras also seem to impair Omega's ability to shape shift.\n\nWhen I personally got to observe Omega it was a beautiful woman. I was told to turn around and then look at Omega again. The woman was now a butterfly. I was completely bewildered and questioning when I saw this. How could something that took such...soft forms truly be a threat? The project lead told me that Omega was only taking calm forms because it was having positive dreams. He also told me that when Omega was first here that it was plagued by constant nightmares and transformed in to things that led several employees to kill themselves.\n\nYou no- Oh god it's free. Currently hiding under a desk. Everyone can hear the noise now, surely it's the sound of death itself.\n\n*Writing becomes more erratic.*\n\nThe power went fully out. Back up lights just kicked on so everything is bathed in a dark red light. Still under the desk, no one else is talking though I do hear a strange noise.\n\nGot up to investigate noise. I could see movement in the far corner of the room but I was having trouble seeing so I flicked my phone's light on it. Mistake. Something happened to the other researchers. Several were hanging inches off the ground, the entrails reaching the whole way up to the ceiling. One of them had a microscope shoved the whole way through the eye and out the back of the skull. A few of them appeared to now be hollow, their ribcages jutting outwards allowing me to see the lack of organs. One of the hollowed out corpses even had another whole corpse shoved inside of it. \n\nThe noise I heard came from behind this carnage. Three researchers sat in a circle eating one another's intestines. The sounds of the flesh ripping was what I heard. One of them noticed me and looked my way with the most haunted eyes I have ever seen. Their mouth contorted in to what I can only assume was a silent scream and then they collapsed, the other two following suit.\n\nI finally started to realize my situation and was beginning to panic so I ran over to the door only to find that it was now open. In the hallway I was immediately greeted with the remains of the Stalker. It was one of the original Stalkers created, one of the most experienced and deadly. Now it was two separate halves, cut clean down the center. Both halves appeared to still be living and were trying to claw their way towards each other.\n\nI ran a bit down the hall before collapsing against the wall. I have since calmed down enough to write this out, I am back and in control. The scientist in me needs to go further. Perhaps I'll find a way out as well.\n\nIt's been several minutes since I've written down the last section and I've finally reached the security area. The glass windows are absolutely covered in blood and gore.  \n\nI've also pondered a bit about my situation as well. I believe Omega awoke and I'm now either in a pocket dimension that is a far cry from the facility I knew or Omega has just altered the matter of my reality to suit it's whims. \n\n*Hastings' handwriting becomes nigh illegible at this point. It took time to decipher his scrawls.*\n\nI can see her. The woman. Omega. On the far side of the hallway looking at me, not moving. Writing this down with out breaking eye contact for fear of attack. \n\nDropped pencil. Had to bend down to get it. Accidentally broke vision. Stupid. Omega is significantly closer, now a tall, sexless creature. Evil eyes. Also can see that Omega is slowly moving closer despite eye contact.\n\n*The writing reverts back to a more readable format.*\n\nA corpse slammed against the window in the security room. I was spooked and flinched away from it for a second. When my eyes opened Omega was gone. Am I a plaything? I definitely saw evil in Omega so this is not an act of mercy.\n\nIt must have been hours since the last time I wrote in this notebook. I've stumbled across Omega twice. The first time it was on the other side of a glass window in the shape of a child. The room was locked so I couldn't get in, though I probably wouldn't have went in regardless. \n\nThe second time I saw it was in the recreation area. It looked like a variation of a Stalker and was playing with the corpses inside. I purposefully broke eye contact to see what it would do. Initially it had it's back turned to me maiming the corpses and biting at them. Then, the posture changed as if it was suddenly picking up on me. It still kept it's back turned to me but slumped down in a seemingly harmless position. When I looked back it was inches from me, hunched over with it's face very close to mine. Contorted scream-looking mouth, eyes black and hateful, teeth sharp and long even for a Stalker. I ran from the room and was not followed.\n\nI think I'm going to try leaving, see if my pocket dimension theory is incorrect.\n\nThe door to leave is wide open, though I can't see any light coming from outside. It must be night at this point or I may actually be in another dimension. I am going to leave my pages here in the facility as well as some of the formulas I was working on for a better containment field for Omega. Someone may need them.\n\n*Hastings' notes end here.*\n\n*Analysis: Omega and Hastings were not found. Our inside source must have planned for both of these things to happen as Organization 440 would not have made the attack knowing such a dangerous entity was poised for escape. Information on Omega as well as Hastings' containment formulas have been found and are being studied. Talks are in session about what to do with Zone 2. They may now possess information on Omega.*\n\n*Case File: Unresolved.*\n\nSecrets here. T left me a note via a Word Document left on my desktop, I believe he/she wanted me to post it at the end of the Case File from the way he/she worded things.\n\n*T's Note: Way to get back on the horse and continue writing Secrets. Proud of you and all that. Now I know you and NoSleep have many, many questions about what happened to you, what's up with the Case Files, and probably as to who or what I am, plus many more questions related to other things I'm sure. So how about we have ourselves a little Q and A? Case File 10 will be a rather short file and then me answering questions that NoSleep will PM you or comment on in Case File 9. I'll answer what I can and what I choose to. Also, I'll just reveal some information about me on the whole. Have fun moving, can't wait to enjoy the heat with you.*\n\nQ and A huh? Well, I decided that I'd go along with it. I need info as much as you guys do and playing this little game is a step towards doing just that. So, after I post Case File 9 PM me or post comments asking questions I guess. I'll leave them in a Word Document on my desktop...though to be fair he knew I was writing Case File 7 out before I posted it so...maybe that's that necessary. Also...it appears he at least knows the climate of the place I'm moving to. Fun. If people know anything or whatever feel free to contact me, I'm sociable enough on most days. Oh, also, the previous Case File...uhm..Case File Exclamation Point or whatever you want to call it may have been passed up by some of you for reading due to weird naming conventions. Just a friendly reminder to check it out if you haven't. As always stay safe NoSleep."

I didn't kill him or do anything to him either, he's currently out and about, preparing to move, doing not being at home things. Anyway, I am writing this little exposition here to...acquaint ourselves before the Q and A. I'm sorry to break the usual formula here but I promise there will only be a few more of these \"Tales\" from me. To tell you the truth I was not going to reveal myself to you or Secrets for a while, so I do apologize for this break in protocol.\n\n*Story Time*\n\nThere were two boys. Friends.\n\nThe boys were oft-seen together, attached at the hip as they say. One was an intellectual, a thinker, a puzzle solver. The other was an explorer, curious to a fault, and courageous. Between the two of them they were the perfect pair. Unbeatable. Unbreakable. Their time was spent adventuring through the woods, through town, through whatever they found and there was nothing that could break their bond. Though there was one who could test it...\n\nEnter the Father. Not friendly. A bad man with a shitty job and a drinking problem. Nothing new, but nothing pretty. He was hateful and spiteful of all, including his son's perfect friendship. Child beatings and bruised ribs, isolation with little consideration of feelings. Yet best friends the two boys did remain. Treading softly around the Father the two boys retained their bond. \n\nOne particular day the two boys stumbled across something while rooting through the attic: Enter the Unknown. Malevolent. Malicious.\n\nUnknown spared the boys to get better acquainted with the dwelling and it's inhabitants: The Father, the two friends and one more. A Mother. Submissive. She would cringe from the Father's touch and abhorrent personality. She was a silent bearer of her shame.\n\nUnknown continued to stay in the house watching Father and Mother as well as being an \"Imaginary Friend\" to the friends. It was a manipulator and a planner, biding time and feeding off their energy.\n\nEventually Unknown started messing with the family. It would bump someone or hide objects, break a window or leave slain animals around the house. At first the two boys were blamed and punished, but then the Father and Mother started noticing the events happening even when the boys were away from the house or at school. An exterminator was called and found nothing, the police were also called upon but could not help in anyway. Enter the Detective. Dutiful.\n\nThe Detective had seen things he couldn't explain away with logic. He had solved cases that had been unsolved for years. He was truly a master of his craft, mixing a firm sense of reality with a willingness to accept alternative causes. He quickly ruled out an animal or a break in so he interviewed Father, Mother, and the two boys.\n\nThe Detective picked up on the evil that was the Father very quickly. He had little desire to help this man but at the end of the day a paycheck was a paycheck. He tried to talk to the Mother about it but she would have nothing to do with his questions and quickly shut off around him. \n\nHe came to questioning the friends. He learned that the friend that was always around was here because his parents were always working and he was afraid of being by himself. The Detective also learned of their Imaginary Friend. He learned how it was always present and always watching the family, and also of the disturbing comments it would make. \n\nThe Detective viewed what information he had and came to several different conclusions: The Father was the cause of all or most of this, that the Mother was finally acting out repressed emotion, or that the friend's Imaginary Friend was somehow to blame. As fate would have it, all three of his conclusions were right in one way or another.\n\nOne evening the Detective decided to stay a bit late to look in to the lesser traveled parts of the house. Unknown did not appreciate the sudden investigation occurring within it's domain and decided to take the vessel with the weakest resistance: the Mother. Countless years of being beat and degraded had lowered her mental health to abysmal levels and Unknown used that to the fullest to take her body from her.\n\nUnknown then attacked the Detective, attempting to strangle him to death. The Father walked in to this scene and let out a forceful strike that hit Mother's frail body. He then lost himself to his usual barely concealed rage and throttled the woman. In the end Father ended the life of Mother and expelled the Unknown from her body. Bitter irony that a piece of shit man like Father would save the Detective.\n\nThe two men worked out a deal where the Father and his son would leave town and settle down elsewhere while the Detective looked in to what made the Mother snap and to delve deeper in to this.\n\nAnd so the other friend was left behind without a goodbye, pondering what had become of his other half.\n\nAnd that's where this chapter closes, but it is not the end of this story, merely fuel to feed your fire. \n\nI know how you all vicariously read through the Case Files. I read what you send Secrets. I know that you want more. Luckily, it suits my needs to entertain you thus far but remember this: you have not stumbled on some ARG. This goes far beyond whatever horror-culture cliche you may think NoSleep holds. Secrets wasn't the first to stumble on Organization 440's works, though he is the first to obtain the entire picture. Do you really know how many of these \"stories\" are accounts or recollections of the Paranormal? Or how many of these \"authors\" were paid or intimidated in to acting like they wrote the stories? Not everyone in the Organization just goes and sends an Operative out to kill people, bribery and intimidation actually keep people alive.\n\nI'm here because someone has to keep Secrets on track. Secrets is here to share these with others. And you. You are here to read and remember. \n\nNow to the intrigue you love so much. I am in these \"Tales\" somewhere. Maybe in this one. Maybe in one of the future ones. But I am in them. Secrets may be in them and he just as equally might not be. He may be both.\n\nI can stick around for a little bit to poke and prod but Secrets will need to get home eventually and freak out at this.\n\nOh. And the name's Tattle."

        "title": "Case File #8 The Villier House",
        "body": "*Case File: 008-695*\n\n*Case File Date: 09/24/1995*\n\n*Location: Rainston, Virginia*\n\n*Subject: O440 Paranormal Squad Three*\n\n*Entity: The Man in the Corner(Subject 695)*\n\n*Squad Three Roster*\n\nRobert DuLange\n\nDane Samuels \n\nRory Jackson\n\nTed Avery\n\nZack Paulson\n\n*Initial briefing given to Squad Three.*\n\nIn Rainston there is a house known by most in the area as being a nexus for haunted happenings. It is known as The Villier House. People around the house go missing, a major portion of the people who enter the house end of dead or mentally incapacitated. We believe that it is either truly a paranormal nexus or that a high level entity has chosen that house as it's dwelling. You are to investigate the house and find the true source of this phenomenon and to take offensive action if you deem it possible.\n\n*This is a report of what we initially knew.*\n\nOn 9/24/1995 Squad Three entered The Viller House. Shortly after they entered the house there was an extreme spike in paranormal energy. The house subsequently locked itself up. Squad One and Squad Four were sent to try and enter the house to retrieve Squad Three but could find no way in to the house. The doors and windows wouldn't break even if fired upon. Squad Three was considered lost until the house opened up a month later. \n\nSquads One, Two, Four, and Five were sent to retrieve Squad Three. Three men were recovered alive: Robert DuLange, Rory Jackson, and Zack Paulson. The full corpse of Dane Samuels was found and parts of Ted Avery were found.\n\nRobert was in a fairly normal state and was able to be interviewed within several days of being recovered from the house. Rory shut out most attempts at communication and would not be interviewed for several months. Zack can still not speak or be communicated with, however several months after being recovered several of our doctors picked up on patterns that were used to get his side of the story.\n\n*Robert's Debriefing*\n\nI guess I'll start with us on route to The Villier House. Rory and Ted were doing their whole Aliens thing again with Rory saying he \"had a bad feeling about this drop.\" and Ted would play along with him and they'd end up quoting half that damn movie. Dane was off in the corner reading schematics or the mission briefing or something technology related, I don't really know. Dane was always the quiet one on the team. Zack spent most of the way there just listening to music or something. Kid sure liked his tunes.\n\nWell, we got there and I gave everyone their entry points. Dane and myself would take the front door, Rory would take the back door, Ted would take the basement door, and Zack had taken a set of stairs to the second floor's back porch and would be taking the second floor door.\n\nI gave the signal and we all entered the house. Dane and I found ourselves in an empty living room. The place was dirty. It had rotten floors, mold in places, missing floorboards every now and then. Right out of a damn haunted house stereotype. \n\nEveryone radioed in that their location was clear so I gave them the ok to set up various scanning equipment. \n\nOur equipment wasn't shoddy either, and I know some of you business management types aren't familiar with our tech so lemme give you a brief rundown. We were all just in regular tactical armor, stuff that SWAT teams and some militaries used. The paranormal don't particularly use guns themselves but have been known to possess others to use weapons on us so that will at least protect us from that.\n\nOur guns were modified rifles or SMGs of various kinds depending on the individual. We were all well trained soldiers and the higher ups let us have our toys. Anyways, all of our guns were special modified to cycle through various types of ammo depending on what type of entity or creature or whatever we were fighting. Up against some type of electric monster? Shoot him with magnetized ammo, fuck him up real good. The more types of entities we discover, the more types of ammo the science teams supply us.\n\nWe had two types of scanners. A handheld one and a stationary longer ranged one. The scanners would pick up on movement, changes in temperature, EMP disturbance, P-Particles, the whole deal. If it was irregular then the scanners could usually pick it up.\n\nSo yeah, everyone was setting up scanners around the house, we were playing things defensive. Then all the doors slammed shut. I ordered everyone to watch their scanners closely for movement and then we'd meet up in the middle of the house.\n\nSuddenly Dane's scanner and my own lit up like crazy and everything went dark for me.\n\nWhen I woke up I was in...a different building or something. I was in the middle of some hallway. The walls were shitty and deteriorating but not like The Villier House. These walls were steel or some type of metal and were rusted and corroding. I looked over to see Dane passed out on the floor beside me. I noticed then that we were both lacking our equipment and weapons. \n\nI didn't want to venture too far down the hallways in case Dane woke up soon but at the same time I wasn't going to sit around doing nothing so I remember that I walked down a direction of the hallway just to see if I could find a door. I guess I should also mention that the halls were lined with shitty fluorescent lighting. Anyways, I walked several minutes down that hall and didn't come across anything so I headed back to where Dane was. He was still out and I sat by his side for what I assumed was several hours before he started to come around.\n\nThat waiting wasn't exactly easy either. It was deathly quiet, like that supernatural quiet where your ears just ring because there is nothing else for them to pick up. Eventually though Dane started to stir a bit and eventually woke up. I asked him what he remembered and what he said pretty much matched up with what I remembered. \n\nDane then brought up what I had been thinking for a bit, that we had fallen for the house's trap and were now in some sort of test, or just being kept somewhere to be killed later.  Dane was also open to the possibility that we were in some sort of illusion or weird pocket dimension as well. The guy was crazy smart so I didn't really argue with any of his theories, I just stood there and let him try to reach a conclusion. In the end Dane figured that if we kept walking we'd either reach some sort of test, the entity, or possibly a weakness in whatever was holding us here.\n\nWe set off in the opposite direction of where I had walked before and passed what must of been an hour without anything happening. At first I was worried we were stuck in a loop of some sort but Dane said he'd picked out a few visible markers in the wall and that we hadn't passed any of them again yet. We really were just in the longest damn hallway ever. \n\nSeveral more hours passed, nothing new happened.\n\nSeveral more after that, still nothing.\n\nI can't believe we didn't go crazy from the lack of anything new and the ringing in our ears. When something did finally happen, well, it was shittier than I had hoped but right along what I had expected.\n\nWe were still slowly creeping down the hallway and suddenly the lights behind us started flicking out. It was a shitty horror movie but actually happening. Slowly the next closest set of lights would flicker out. Dane and I knew enough about horror movies to know we didn't want to let the dark catch up with us so we picked up the pace and started jogging. \n\nHah, I see the look you're giving me but yes we jogged, just fast enough that we were outpacing the darkness and were slowly pulling away from it. What good would it have done us to panic and spring just to wear ourselves out? We're trained soldiers not freakin' teenagers waiting to take a machete to the head.\n\nAnyway that plan didn't work out so well for us. The darkness picked up it's pace so that our jog was now a run, no way we could've kept that up for a long period of time. I'd say a good ten or fifteen minutes passed with us running and the darkness was only a couple sets of lights when we finally saw relief. A door on the left side of the hall. It was rusted like everything else but Dane ripped the door open and we both veered in, slamming the door shut on whatever was in the hall.\n\nWe caught our breath and checked out the new area we were in: a small room, no bigger than the living room of my apartment. Ceiling must've been about seven or eight feet, cement floor, walls were now more like painted cinderblock, a dull white with an off green stripe. Sorta reminded me of a school or hospital room. There was nothing else in it 'cept for the one lightbulb hanging from the ceiling.\n\nI remember swearing for a good minute or so while Dane just sat there analyzing stuff. You know, Dane always was a good thinker...given a few years he'd probably have gotten a squad of his own. He'd have had one by then if he was just a little bit more of a leader.\n\nDane figured our current situation was at least mildly better than in the hallway and that we should take a few minutes to rest. I didn't argue and actually ended up dozing off. I woke up to Dane calling for help and struggling to close the door we came in. Pushing in from the hallway was...well, the darkness. Black tendrils or tentacles or something were trying to pry the door open. I jumped up and threw all my weight in to the door and actually managed to slam it shut. I swore that I saw some of the tendrils get cut off and fall to the floor but when I looked down all I saw was cement. \n\nDane slumped down against the door. He looked like shit, pale and scared. I asked him what had happened since I'd nodded off. He told me what happened and I actually remember what he said pretty well:\n\n\"As soon as you went to sleep I began to investigate the room more thoroughly. I was looking for clues of some sort, at best a hidden door of some sort. I searched the entire floor area first and came up with nothing. I then checked around the walls looking for maybe some loose paint or a seam of some sort. When I got to the far corner of the room I got this...off feeling, almost like a sense of dread. That made me spin around towards the door which was now wide open. The hallway outside was entirely dark and the only thing I could see was the silhouette of a person, maybe a humanoid? All I could tell is that the figure was portly. I ran over to the door to close it and that's when I called for you Sir.\"\n\nNow I see you looking at me again. You're a business-managment type so I'll clue you in a bit. In training we are taught to trust any weird feeling we get. The human body rejects the unnatural. Dane felt that thing in the doorway and it made him spin around. Hell, I bet my body was unnerved too even though I was sleeping. \n\nI wish I could say that Dane and I manned up and went out in to that hallway kicking ass and escaped. Didn't happen. Shortly after we got that door closed the lightbulb started flickering. I think Dane and I knew that we were fucked if we stayed in the room at that point so we tried to rip open the door, it wouldn't budge a damn inch. Light went out and I felt my body thrown to the floor. I was unable to move, unable to speak, just cold and in the dark.\n\nAn unknown amount of time goes by with me laying in the dark when the light flicks back on. I noticed three things immediately: It's a ton dimmer now, enough that there's darkness in the corners of the room, Dane is laying several feet to my right breathing but not moving, and that there's a large man standing in the corner of the room. Just so you know he was fat like Dane said, not some of those tall shits the science guys always fuss about.\n\nThe darkness turned back in to a living creature of some sort, I could almost see it breathing. The Man in the Corner turned to face us and as he walked closer I began to see that he pretty much had a featureless face. Bald. Two perfect circles for eyes, literally perfect circles, that had two little black dots in the center. I can't remember the nose. He might have had one, maybe he didn't, I just can't remember. I do remember his mouth though. It was the most confident smirk you've ever fucking seen, like he knew exactly what was going to happen at all times or was privy to the secret of the universe. I think I remember him wearing like an undershirt for a suit or something and then just dress pants but I really wasn't focusing on anything past that face.\n\nHe walked over to where Dane was laying and bent down to touch him. As soon as his hand touched Dane the darkness in the corners of the room leapt towards him and started pushing down his eye sockets and mouth. Dane kinda struggled for a bit, kicked for awhile, and then he went still. Stupid fat fuck..and he was looking at me now. \n\nI was ready for him to touch me and let the darkness take me or whatever but he just stared at me for a bit. His smirk was gone, his little dot eyes were shaking a bit.\n\nThen? I don't really know. I woke up in the damn living room of The Villier House laying next to Dane with Hoffer and his damn Squad One shaking us, Dane was dead, I wasn't. \n\nI later found out who else had made it and died...as well as everyone's condition. Rory is still shut up inside himself and Zack is off the damn reservation. I know that you and some men behind the glass back there are trying to figure out my condition as well and I'm going to speak to you plain.\n\nShit happens with this job. I'm upset that I lost my squad, I'm upset that you chose to send only my squad in to an unknown situation, I'm upset that Hoffer probably saved my life, fucking dick that he is. But you pay us good money to do what we do and I feel like I'm keeping kids or innocents from stumbling across these nightmares. I may not be the smartest man around but I'm stubborn enough and apparently you deem me good enough to lead. Give me a week off or something and then let me train up a batch of newbies. Oh, and tell Hoffer I'm coming for his job.\n\n*Robert DuLange resumed command of his Squad several weeks after this debriefing.*\n\n*Further Case Details: The Man in the Corner now known as Subject 695 has been captured through less than tactful means. The Villier House was ripped from the ground and air transported to base. Many citizens of Rainston had to be bribed, threatened, or taken to keep this information from spreading further.*\n\n*Rory's Debriefing*\n\nIt's been a couple of months since my incident and I'm still having trouble talking about it but I believe I can now share my part of the mission. I'm sure Robert gave you the overall rundown on the mission so I'll just start with when I entered the house.\n\nI opened the back door and entered the house, I ended up in a kitchen, a really dirty kitchen. I checked my corners, covered the various entrances, looked for hiding spots. Nothing. I radioed in an all clear as I rifled through the cabinets and fridge, not that it mattered since they ended up being empty. Rob gave the order to set up scanners and I did just that. I set up my larger scanner and pulled out my hand scanner. The hand scanner caught something coming from a far door and then suddenly the outside doors and window coverings snapped shut. Rob threw up some warning on the radio and I started walking to that far door when I heard my floor scanner go crazy. I remember trying to turn around to see the scanner and then I must've blacked out.\n\nI woke up laying on a gurney in some rundown hospital. I admit that I panicked a little and called out for the others when I should've laid low and checked my surroundings. No one replied and nothing rushed in to the room to kill me so I got up and left the room. \n\nNow, all my equipment was missing as well as my gun so I attempted to keep to the walls and make my way down the hall. \n\nI eventually found a map of the hospital on the wall and used it to get my bearings. The hospital had an East and West Wing as well as the Emergency Rooms located in the central part of the hospital. I was on the second floor of the West Wing. Now that I had a general idea of where I was I began to search through every room in the West Wing. I believe all of them were completely empty except for one room. One of the rooms contained an old...like...well, a gentleman's hat or old hat. I can't remember what they're called right now but it was just laying in the corner of the room. This is all I found in the West Wing.\n\nI made my way to the central part of the hospital and tried to leave through the front entrance, doors did not budge at all. I punched them, kicked them, pushed them, pulled them and nothing happened. \n\nI was getting bad vibes from the Emergency Rooms so I checked out the East Wing. After an hour of searching the rooms I came up with nothing and was back to the main lobby with the entrance doors and the Emergency Rooms.\n\nI entered the Emergency Room hallway to see that there was about 10 or so rooms in it. I checked out the first two sets of rooms without finding anything. When I returned to the hallway I saw someone entering a room on the far side of the hall.\n\nAt the time I thought it could've been someone from the squad so I went over to that room and went in without hesitation. Had I actually stopped to think about it though I would've realized how slim those chances were and have been more cautious. \n\nAs I opened the door I saw the outline of someone in the corner of the room. My creepy vibes were pretty much max at this point but my fear of being alone here overcame that and I walked over to the person. As I hit about the halfway point of the room the light went out for maybe five or six seconds. \n\nWhen the lights came back on...well, traumatized me enough for my entire life. The tiled floor, walls, and ceiling of the hospital were no longer building materials. Now the walls were fleshy and lined with fanged mouths and eyes. The ceiling looked like it was breathing. And the floor was covered with grubs and worms. The Man in the Corner turned around and I saw that it was no member of my team. It struck me then that I was most likely trapped in this horrible room with the very entity I was sent to hunt.\n\nHe gave me a quick smile, which was actually more of a smirk now that I think about it, and started walking over to me. I've read bits of Rob's report and I can tell you that this was definitely the same thing: dressy clothes, fairly rotund, the eyes, even that smirk. Well, he came over to me and grasped my shoulder. \n\nThe ceiling started spasming, the mouthes in the walls started biting and all the eyes were looking angrily at me. The worst part were the bugs, they started crawling up my legs and I could not move. I couldn't slap them off. I was entirely helpless. I looked up to see the Man walking back towards the corner. I closed my eyes with the bugs climbing up my neck and when I opened them again I was in the kitchen with members of the other squads around me.\n\nEvery night from then on I have a nightmare where the mission repeats itself. I believe it will keep me out of the Organization's squads for the rest of my life. Also, I really didn't want to talk about this at all so I may have skipped some descriptive details just to tell my part as quick as possible. I didn't leave out anything that would be vital so don't worry about it so much. I need to excuse myself now.\n\n*Rory Jackson is now locked up in a mental institute run by the Organization after attempting to kill himself.*\n\n*Zack's Debriefing: Told by his Head Trauma Counselor*\n\nZack Paulson was difficult to figure out for several months. He lost the ability to talk and the only medium we could get him to interact with was art, specifically colored pencil drawings. Initially there was no rhyme or reason for his drawings but several of his caretakers as well as myself noticed patterns in the drawings. Apparently Zack was telling several separate stories through multiple perspectives with his drawings. I confirmed it when I read through Robert DuLange's debriefing. Zack had basically drawn out the entirety of those events but through Dane Samuel's eyes.\n\nWe actually missed this initially because he didn't draw them in any order or set. We looked through all the drawings that corresponded to Dane and noticed that he hid small numbers somewhere in the drawings so that we could put them in order. Zack appears to have drawn his last picture because as soon as he was finished he returned the remaining paper and his pencils back to their drawer and will no longer go near them.\n\nBesides Dane we also have sets of drawings that correspond to Zack and Ted Avery, as well as one other set of pictures that may shed some light on this entity.\n\nI will also only be summarizing what can be surmised from the drawings. This will lead to rather short but detail heavy debriefs.\n\n*Ted's Story*\n\nThe drawings start in the transport with Ted looking at Rory Jackson and the other members. Eventually Ted is in the basement of The Villier House. The drawings show it being filled with racks of undershirts, black slacks, and old top hats and bowler hats. \n\nThe next piece of paper is colored completely black and I believe it is of Ted passing out much like the others.\n\nTed wakes up in what looks like a mineshaft. The drawing contains mine carts and various strings of lighting that are used in mines. Ted roams the mines for awhile and I think he was frightened by something because most of the drawings show Ted's arms and legs in a sprinting position.\n\nHe was running down a long mine shaft when he appears to look over to an intersecting shaft where you can barely make out what I believe is the entity. Both Robert and Rory referred to it as The Man in the Corner so I will as well. Ted either doesn't notice the Man or doesn't react to him too much as he keeps running down the shaft.\n\nThere is actually a lot of drawings of him just running until the edges of the drawings start becoming dim and black. I believe this shows exhaustion on Ted's part.\n\nTed eventually trips over a mine cart rail and falls over. When he spins around there are spider like creatures on the edges of his vision. One of them appears to be about the size of a mine cart in the drawings so I actually believe Ted was being chased by large spider-like creatures. \n\nHe attempts to get up but the closest one snags his leg and drags him back to the other creatures. This leads to him being held my his arms and legs by the creatures and flailing to get free. The Man in the Corner is shown to be leaning out of a side shaft and walking towards him. The Man walks closer to Ted in each drawing and eventually touches his stomach. At that very moment the spider-creatures pull on Ted's limbs until they tear off. \n\nThis set of drawings end with most of the page covered in black with just a small drawing in the center of what appears to be a mouth smirking.\n\n*Zack's Story*\n\nZack's drawings actually differ from the other series because he had headphones on playing music during the entire mission. For some reason Zack remembered exactly what was playing during his encounter and wrote the lyrics and some musical notes at the bottom of each of his drawings. Now, I don't believe that the lyrics themselves are important but rather that he chose to write them down in the first place since he has written no other words. \n\nZack ends up in a bedroom of some sort in The Villier House. Zack sees a blur of movement in the doorway and raises his gun to it when he blacks out.\n\nThe next section of Zack's drawings are...interesting. Parts of the drawing appear to be a dark forest of some kind while other parts of the same page will be of The Villier house. Something to note is that when Zack's right arm is shown in the house he his still holding his weapon but that it is empty when in the forest. I personally think that Zack was supposed to go to a forest much like everyone else was supposed to be transported to other places except that the music that was constantly playing in his ear was keeping him grounded to the house or to reality or something, I don't study the entities and I have no desire to start.\n\nZack roams through the forest-house hybrid until he reaches the basement of the house/the tree roots of a giant tree. He appears to search through the racks quickly with his gun trained on him. In the forest sections there are rather menacing eyes popping up around him.\n\nZack notices The Man in the Corner in...well, the corner of the basement, staring at him with eyes different from the other pictures. Angry. In the forest a clawed arm of some sort is seen reaching for Zack out of the darkness. Zack aims his gun at the Man and shoots in his direction. The Man disappears from the corner, leaving a couple blood splatters, and Zack is seen running upstairs with more hands grabbing for him in the forest.\n\nHe gets up to the first floor and appears to be looking around. The hands in the forest parts appear to be flimsy and wobbling, rather weak in their overall appearance. Zack appears to take several more steps before collapsing. When he wakes up several soldiers are around him and he takes the headphones off, ending the lyrics. The rest of his drawings just relate to his time at the clinic here.\n\n*The Other Set of Drawings*\n\nThis set of drawings contains five pictures that helped me piece together a little bit more about The Man in the Corner. \n\nThe first drawing is the living room of The Villier house with Robert and Dane laying on the ground. The Man in the Corner is in the picture smothering Dane his head turned directly towards the person viewing the drawing.\n\nThe second drawing is of the kitchen. Rory is sprawled out near a side door and The Man in the Corner can be see leaning out from behind the fridge, once again staring at the person viewing the drawing.\n\nThe third drawing is in the basement. It shows Ted having his leg ripped off by The Man in the Corner while he stares down the viewer.\n\nThe forth drawing is of the bedroom. Zack is seen struggling to get up and The Man in the Corner can be seen in a mirror looking at Zack angrily. \n\nThe final drawing that Zack drew was in this very building. It's a drawing of Zack sitting at the table where he drew most of these and me leaning over his shoulder. It was probably set in the past three months or so. Outside the window a bit in the distance is The Man in the Corner staring in.\n\nI'm resigning from this position and moving. I advise you to provide better containment measures for the entity as I believe it has tricked you in to thinking it is contained. \n\nMy final analysis on all of this is that the entity appears to teleport people's consciousness to other realms and then attacking their physical bodies to kill them. I'm no expert on these things though so I'll leave you to study further. Just please contain him. For Zack and my sake.\n\n*Zack and the Head Trauma Counselor are now missing. Better security measures have been placed around Subject 695 although we have proof that it was in containment since we have relocated The Villier House.*\n\n*Case File: Closed.*\n\nSecrets here, posting the very first Case File from my new apartment. Awesome. But yes, I am now living in a new location far from my hometown. \n\nI don't actually have much to say about the Case File itself. It seems standard fare for Organization 440 although I now believe that not 100% of the people in Organization 440 are evil. I mean...I figured that anyways but written proof is always good too. \n\nNothing new has happened with Tattle. Remember that Case File 9 will probably be the last time to ask Tattle questions for his Q and A. \n\nI'll also answer anything relevant that I can in the comments below. So...as always, stay safe NoSleep."

        "title": "Case File #9 The Tulpa Project",
        "body": "All info regarding the usual info is redacted much like when I went through The Hysteria Project so let's just get in to this.\n\n*Doctor Harry Marlowe's Introduction to The Tulpa Project*\n\nIt has been several years since my initial success with The Hysteria Project. I have been the lead on two moderately successful projects since then, The Mannequin Armament Project and Project Artemis. A new project was brought to my attention, one that could possibly thrive under my supervision and leadership: The Tulpa Project.\n\nTulpa is not a new concept in the least. Buddhist monks have used Tulpa as one of the center principals of their faith, and many researchers in the public eye are starting to conduct extremely basic tests of Tulpa. But Organization 440 already knows the potential, the research already done can be found in your info packets. Our job is to see what we can create with Tulpa whether it be powerful new soldiers, new operatives, or just a new way to create and destroy.\n\nWe have a total of 120 subjects ranging from children to adults, students to military men to murderers. Our goal will be twofold: To test and improve individual Tulpa use/progression/strength and to test group Tulpa in use/progression/strength.\n\nInitially we will test each subjects ability to focus, project their thoughts, and manifest ideas to the physical plane. Any subjects who show a lack of aptitude or are quite skilled at projecting their Tulpa will be singled out for various testing. Harsh regimens will be provided for the bottom tier to see if a rough stimulus can increase their power. The high tier will have very light testing mainly to determine details that we can use to emulate their strength in the future. Mid tier will continue regular testing to see if they develop more power if given a little more time.\n\nAfter individual testing has brought out the cream of the crop we will proceed to group Tulpa testing to see what the limits and abilities of it are. Many of the tests will be similar to individual but preformed on small groups of subjects instead of the individual. After that we will move on to using all remaining subjects in one large group.\n\nThe top several subjects will be heavily evaluated to see if they can be turned in to Operatives or tools to aid the Organization. Live combat testing may or may not occur at my discretion.\n\n*Research notes of Dr. Marlowe: Pre-Project Musings*\n\nAll the subjects have been brought in to their rooms and are being interviewed and assimilated in to the program. Several of them have already caught my eye though. A serial killer, a set of twins, a man with severe amnesia, a young boy with ties to an entity, and an artist who specializes in lucid dreaming.\n\nOver the next week we will be scanning their brainwaves as they try to concentrate and think things in to reality, their focus and natural ability will be gauged and I can start putting them in to tiers. The task that they will be trying to accomplish is to extend their psyche, and therefore their ability to sense the environment, and to attempt to will several small objects in to existence. \n\nI'm fairly confident that none of them will actually be able to create the small object, however the extension of the psyche should be within some of their ranges of ability.\n\n*Research notes of Dr. Marlowe: One*\n\n*Note: The current figures are rough initial estimations. Certain subjects are in in-between Tier levels and have been lumped in to a Tier at this early stage in the project.*\n\nLow Tier: 55 Subjects\n\nMid Tier: 45 Subjects\n\nTop Tier: 20 Subjects\n\nThe first week of testing has come to a conclusion. As expected we have a majority of Low Tier subjects. Also as expected, my special six subjects are within the Top Tier.\n\nThe brainwave scans have proven useful thus far as we've noticed that the more creative parts of the brain are used in Tulpa. I feel that any artists or creative-centric subjects will thrive in this project while more serious and noncreative subjects will be kept to the Low Tier. Of course there is also room for noncreative subjects to have more concentrated willpower and be able to be successful with Tulpa as well. \n\nAlso of note is that the senses of several subjects have increased due to an improved and extended psyche. The subjects claim that they can feel the research staff approaching their rooms and two of them have accurately guessed the number of staff in the entire building.\n\n*Research notes of Dr. Marlowe: Two*\n\nLow Tier: 49 Subjects\n\nMid Tier: 48 Subjects\n\nTop Tier: 23 Subjects\n\nIt has been several weeks since my last set of notes. We've had several developments since then and I am quite pleased with where things seem to be progressing.\n\nFirst off, we've looked in to the young boy in more detail. The boy is only three years of age so a lot of the testing is being modified to accommodate him. He's the youngest subject we have by far and if not for his special condition I would not have used him in this project. It seems that the entity has latched on to his psyche. It has a separate and slightly smaller brainwave that accompanies his own. The Tulpa practice is strengthening both the boy and the entity.\n\nThe serial killer has developed some less than normal habits. He had killed women in the past for reasons he would not disclose to the police or to us. Now he seems to talk to his past victims and interact with them as though they were actually there. We know for a fact that there are no ghosts within his cell so he may be using Tulpa to recreate his victims. I can only hope that he is successful.\n\nAmusingly similar to my original Aegis twins, the twins in this project seem to be able to create more in tandem than any of the other subjects. I'd initially write this off as them having the advantage of group Tulpa use but they are 400% above the next most proficient subject. The twins have willed a silver fork in to being and we will be stepping up their tests to include larger and more complicated objects.\n\nThe lucid dreamer is the next proficient subject after the twins. She is also one of the two that has the heightened sense ability. It is my personal belief that the lucid dreamer will probably get more creative use out of Tulpa then some of our other subjects due to her imagination and prior training in how to focus.\n\nThere have been a few other subjects that show promise but I feel like the success rate overall may be lower than my previous projects. Nevertheless, success is still success.\n\nThe project will now take a slightly archaic turn. Both the Nazis and Soviets have attempted Tulpa experiments in the past. A common trial of theirs was to have their subject attempt to create a second version of themselves or a \"living imaginary friend\". A lot of these tests ended with the subject losing their sense of being or losing control of the projection and being killed by them. I plan to keep several safeguards in place that should minimize this from happening.\n\n*Research notes of Dr. Marlowe: Three*\n\nLow Tier: 47 Subjects\n\nMid Tier: 48 Subjects\n\nTop Tier: 20 Subjects\n\nFive subjects are now dead after the newest trial, two Mid Tier subjects and three Top Tier. Two of our Low Tier subjects have improved and moved up to Mid Tier so at least that loss has been mitigated somewhat.\n\nTwo of the five dead subjects simply lost their sense of being and we believe they lost their grasp on life. One of the subjects killed themselves after having their projection tell them that it was going to kill their friends and family after the project was over. One subject repeatedly slammed his head in to the wall until his skull caved in. Normally I'd count this as an act of suicide but you can see the subject struggling at various times which lead me and several others to believe he was killed by a hostile projection. The final deceased subject was thrown around the room much like a child's rag doll. The corpse was quite broken by the time personnel got to it. Just another case of an uncontrolled projection.\n\nThe serial killer has gained tremendous progress with his projections of his former victims. They can now physically interact with the environment even though we can still not see them. It is confirmed that these are projections of his will and not ghosts coming back to haunt him so I believe that he may have killed these women out of lust and is now creating versions of them that accept him. \n\nThe young boy and his entity have had some progress as well. For the first time since entering the program the entity's brainwaves are stronger than the boys. It looks like the entity has not taken over the boy's body though and I'm not entirely sure why. My theory is that it's waiting for the boy to be stronger to do the takeover but long term observation may be necessary. \n\nThe amnesiac has finally started to shine too. He has almost no memory to draw from so when he creates items or people they have interesting twists to them. His manifestations of people seem to interact outside social norms and he finally created a dagger that was spiraling and triple bladed.\n\nThe rest of the subjects have also made leaps and bounds with this trial. The vast majority of them can now sense the entire building by \"feeling out\" with their psyche and most of the Top Tier can actually leave the building spiritually. I have high hopes that we will be able to create spies or scanners with the subjects best at these technique. \n\nI have the basic regimen for the Low Tier nearly finalized. They will be pushed to the breaking point, traumatized, and hopefully left in an easily suggestible state. My hope is that if they are all in the same mindset that a group Tulpa session with the entire Low Tier may prove to be fruitful and that they can be used as one giant tool as opposed to useless individuals.\n\n*Research notes of Dr. Marlowe: Four*\n\nLow Tier: 1 Subject\n\nMid Tier: 45 Subjects\n\nTop Tier: 23 Subjects\n\nSeveral months have passed since I've last sent in my notes and we've had some...interesting turns with the Low Tier subjects. \n\nA few of the researchers under me voiced concerns and objections to what I put the Low Tier through but I had to remind them that total failure would not be tolerated by the top floor. In the end I convinced everyone to go through with my regimen. \n\nThe 47 subjects were initially subjected to disturbing footage that I compiled. Japanese demons caught on security cameras, Russian suicide videos, video taped cult rituals gone wrong, and the like. A crass collection to say the least but effective. A large portion of the subjects were thoroughly disturbed but no deaths occurred at this stage, the trauma that I needed had not been obtained yet.\n\nThe next stage in this regimen had each subject locked in a small, dark room akin to a prison cell. On the left and right side of the cell the walls are chained and a mannequin is in each cell. At this point I decided to sacrifice several subjects to quicken the pace for the rest. The chains were cut in several places to allow the mannequins to break through and kill the subjects within. Ten subjects were sacrificed this way. The gore was not cleaned, the walls were repaired so that the next set of subjects would not be killed, and the subjects were then subjected to the mannequins and the slowly rotting gore. This proved incredibly effective and the vast majority of the remaining subjects were finally in the state of mind and mental health that I was trying to obtain. \n\nThe few subjects that were resilient to the mental trauma I was looking for were subjected to several horrors conjured by the Tome of Volos. This was not a method I wanted to use in case it contaminated their mental being but I decided that using it on the six remaining subjects would not do much harm.\n\nThe 37 subjects were brought to the Group Tulpa Testing Room and instructed to project their will in to one mass of energy. My plan had been to use that energy to bring a large or complicated object in to existence but I had another happy accident in my research.\n\nThe influence of the six subjects subjected to Volos changed my plans completely. Volos, or an aspect of Volos, managed to enter the mass projection and infect the other 31 subjects. What was left of their personalities, emotions, and thoughts ended up being mixed and transferred between them all. The Biblical story about Legion actually comes to mind at this point as they became a collective consciousness. From what we have learned in this brief time the consciousness possesses all 37 bodies simultaneously so that none of the subjects are individuals any more. I believe the consciousness itself is kept in a constantly projected state and is not held within any of the subjects. Another thing to note is that we are firmly in control of the consciousness' actions. It seems the constant trauma I had them put through overrides any loyalty to Volos they may have.\n\nIn a moment of generosity I let a researcher below me name this new entity and was surprised that he actually had sound logic. He named it The Thrall and as the consciousness is made of the lowest Tier of subjects I agree completely on the name.\n\nThe Thrall's chief ability is it's sensing/scanning. We've been able to track Fidel Castro's every movement in his villa for the past three days. Every move he made and every word he said has been memorized by The Thrall and can be relayed back to us at any time. This is better than any satellite scanning technology that will be emerging over the next several years. The Thrall also seems to have gained a very small portion of Volos based powers: The subjects can utilize tendrils when faced with danger and it seems that The Thrall can use a combination of Tulpa and otherworldly power to summon some Volos-inspired entities to temporarily protect itself. A full investigation of The Thrall will be conducted separately as it is no longer a Tulpa based subject.\n\nThe Mid Tier is progressing under the regular testing for an extended period of time to close the gap with the Top Tier. Several adept subjects have caught my eye within the current Mid Tier that I hope ascend to the Top Tier.\n\nAs far as the Top Tier is concerned my favorite six are still towards the top of the Tier. The twins collectively are number one with the lucid dreamer a close second. We've started the relaxed testing on the Top Tier to identify the exact parts of the brain that revolve around Tulpa but I believe I have a theory brewing already. \n\n*Research notes of Dr. Marlowe: Five*\n\nLow Tier: 1 Subject\n\nMid Tier: 21 Subjects\n\nTop Tier: 13 Subjects\n\nWe've lost a portion of our subjects since my last set of notes. It's unfortunate but I will make progress and achieve success even with these losses. First a group of subjects decided to try and escape, they planned to use their scanning abilities to avoid researchers and to slip out of the facility to some place. Fortunately for me, I'm not a trusting man. I put The Thrall to work scanning all subjects constantly and found out several things. Some of the subjects had gained the ability to project their thoughts in to other people's heads. The weaponized purpose of this would be to brainwash, mentally attack, suggest soldiers to switch sides, make an army kill itself, etc. The subjects with this power were using it just to convey messages which was equally useful. The Thrall picked up on the messages and relayed them back to us. Another useful ability of The Thrall is that it's Tulpa abilities are so unique and twisted that it could actually hide squads of soldiers from the subject's scanning projections. \n\n24 Mid Tier subjects and 10 Top Tier subjects made their breakout attempt. The soldiers I had placed captured all the subjects with tranquilizers and I decided to see if they could be conditioned and added to The Thrall. They are currently in the first stage of that process.\n\nThe group testing has finally commenced. The 34 subjects that remain were set to focus their willpower on certain objects. With their combined focus we were able to create what I believe was a wormhole or portal of some sort. I don't mean to be vague with the details on this but this is a lot of unknown ground being covered at a quick pace. I didn't have as much time as I wanted to observe the portal but I believe the destination may have been determined by the strongest Tulpa users in the group while the others just fueled it with willpower. Speculation of course, but that's sometimes all we have.\n\nThe group was also able to create objects like small cars and sheds. To make something out of nothing...truly we are recreating the laws that govern our universe here and it is so exciting. The potential that Tulpa holds is just staggering. \n\n*Research note of Dr. Marlowe: Five*\n\nLow Tier: 1 Subject\n\nMid Tier: 14 Subjects\n\nTop Tier: 10 Subjects\n\nI tried to integrate the rebellious subjects to The Thrall today. In an interesting turn of events it only accepted the lowest of the Mid Tier subjects in to its consciousness. The other subjects were torn limb from limb by the tendrils. I believe that The Thrall only accepts subjects akin to its current caliber so that one High Tier subject doesn't gain control of the consciousness due to having more power.\n\nWe've had complications with the young boy as well. The entity latched on to him seems to have made it's move and has boosted both it's and the boy's brainwaves to rather high levels. What seems to be happening is that the entity is siphoning willpower, the boys very power of belief to use Tulpa to make it stronger and to increase the boys willpower so that it has more to leech from. The problem with this is that the entity has found a loophole in Tulpa. If given enough time it can literally will itself in to becoming a god. As an act of mercy I used several of our emerging techniques and tools to shut the entity back in to the boy in a dormant state. This had a twofold effect. The boy acquired almost all of the willpower built up between the two of them and he also went in to a coma that may or may not be long term. I've had him transferred to a civilian hospital and if he ever recovers he will be put in an orphanage. The entity may or may not reemerge in the future so the boy will be watched his entire life. \n\nWe had more bad news as the serial killer lost control of his Tulpa projections. He was so close to having living beings formed from his projections, they actually flickered on the physical plane from time to time. I believe the stress of trying to make them real coupled with any guilt he may have had seeped in to the projections, and in the end I watched as three flickering forms dislocated his jaw and crawled inside him. An autopsy revealed that organs had been severed within him. I believe the best news to take from this is that we are learning more about how to deal with \"living projections\". The mental state of the person using Tulpa to project another consciousness must be a healthy mind and well in control of their thoughts. If one negative thought were to manifest in their projection that'd be more than enough to endanger them and others. \"Living projections\" will be limited to certain subjects from now on.\n\nAnother turn of events is that one of the twins killed his brother. It seems that jealousy struck and we found the dead brother impaled upon many sharp objects. Security footage shows that the one brother was jealous that his twin was slowly pulling ahead in performance and pushed his brother. Before the boy could hit the ground the space behind him was littered with nails, forks, knives, sharp tools of different shapes. While it is sad to see a twin go I have finally seen a combat use for Tulpa and it was wonderful.\n\nWe've finally identified some aspects about Tulpa that may actually make it harder to recreate subjects in the future. It seems that everyone's creativity levels, personal experiences, mental state, ability to focus, and willpower will always be different. These are the core traits that define Tulpa. I've come to the conclusion that while we won't be able to recreate any one subject easily we will be able to find people better suited to use Tulpa.\n\nI will attempt to train the remaining subjects in combat Tulpa use and then proceed with Live Testing.\n\n*Live Testing Sequence*\n\nThe Live Testing Sequences put a subject in a large, yet contained room with simulated debris, light levels, and other variables to simulate an actual encounter zone. Subjects will be pit against U.S. Special Forces/Mercenaries/and various other people with combat training who have been told that they are performing a live fire drill, with no other knowledge of what they will be experiencing.\n\n*Subject One: The Twin*\n\nA soldier is introduced to the environment and proceeds to make his way across the terrain. The Twin quickly finds him by reaching out with his psyche and closes the distance between the two while remaining hidden. The Twin focuses for a second and our instruments pick up an immense wave of willpower. The Twin has created a perfect projection of either himself or his twin behind the soldier. The projection sneaks up behind the man and...phases/oozes in to the back of the him. The soldier falls over dead. \n\nWe're still picking up traces of the projection even after the Live Testing has ended. I believe the Twin has fully recreated his brother and is using him/it as a weapon. As for the soldier, I believe the projection entered his body and/or consciousness and simply switched off his organs. A tactful way to kill.\n\n*Subject Two: The Lucid Dreamer*\n\nThe Lucid Dreamer quickly closes the gap between her opponent and herself. She watched the soldier creep around a bit, waiting for something. She throws her voice to some rubble a bit off the main path, whether or not she actually had this talent or used Tulpa to achieve it is unknown. The soldier approaches the rubble with his rifle trained on it and the Lucid Dreamer shows an impressive amount of forethought and creative Tulpa use. She \"flips\" the gravity of the soldier so that the ceiling is now the floor for him. Normally this would be a large fall that would most likely break the soldier's leg except the Lucid Dreamer lured him to a place where the ceiling was jagged with iron posts and bars created from a past Live Test. The soldiers body ends up impaled on the posts.\n\nSomething to note is that the Lucid Dreamer had to stop moving and concentrate forcefully to switch the soldier's gravity. I also believe that she only has enough willpower to do this on a single target and that she'd need assistance or more training to be effective against groups.\n\n*Subject Three: The Amnesiac*\n\nThe Amnesiac and the soldier enter the testing area. The Amnesiac crouches down low and with surprising agility he climbs and scales certain chunks of rubble. He gets on a vantage point above the soldier and in an expert fashion he wills a knife in to being and hurls in right in to the base of the spinal cord of the soldier.\n\nThe quickness of this test took a lot of us by surprise. Initially we knew about as much of the Amnesiac as he did, however it is now clear that he must come from a military background, most likely a special forces unit of some type. Seems he'll make a valuable combat operative after all.\n\n*Subject Four: The Whore*\n\nThe soldier enters the testing area and immediately finds a defensible position. The Whore uses her scanning abilities to pinpoint the location of the soldier. At this point we also believe the Whore probes the mind of the soldier to learn certain things, particularly sexual preferences. The Whore closes the gap between herself and the soldier and as she gets closer she sheds her clothing. Right before she enters his line of sight our instruments pick up a spike in willpower. The Whore's body begins to make subtle changes: her legs become more shapely, enlarged bosom, her hair color goes from brown to black, her skin tone darkens, and her facial features change slightly. Where a ragged caucasian woman once stood is now a latino model. The Whore walks up to the soldier with ease, he even lowers his weapon, and she goes to kiss him. Another spike of willpower is registered and she reverts back to her original features. A quick flash of her tongue is seen, barbed and elongated, as it is shoved down the soldier's mouth and throat. His body twitches for several seconds before collapsing. \n\nThe Whore was a prostitute that was abducted off the street as one of our random subjects to be introduced in to the program. Initially she was Low Tier but worked her way up to the top of the Mid Tier. I believe that with a little more time she will ascend to the Top Tier. She is a perfect example of Tulpa use being twisted by past experience and comfort zones. The Whore led a sex based life and her Tulpa mirrors it. She's also the only subject that we know of that can alter parts of their body as extensively as her through sheer willpower. As for her method of attack, it seems her tongue snaked it's way through the soldier and lacerated his vital organs.\n\n*Subject Five: The Marine*\n\nThe Marine enters the area before the soldier does. He is set in a dead sprint to where the soldier will be exiting. The Marine hides behind a small chunk of rubble near the soldier's entrance to the testing area. When the soldier finally enters the area the Marine vaults over the rubble and throws a punch that connects with the side of his face, a spike in willpower used is registered, and several more punches connect. The jaw of the soldier has torn away from one side of the face and is dangling from the remaining side. The Marine give one last final punch and this time his hand phases through the head and in to the brain instantly killing the soldier.\n\nAnother subject that was in the Low Tier but worked his way up, the Marine is a shining example of having next to no creativity but the will to succeed. It seems that he used Tulpa to accent his punches to inhuman levels. He was also able to phase his hand through solid matter to reach the brain of his opponent. Simple and brutal weapons but effective all the same.\n\n*Remaining Subjects*\n\nThe remaining subjects met with different amounts of success. Some killed their opponent outright, some were killed in return. A common trait that they all shared however is the ability to sense opponents, the ability to will simple melee weapons in to existence, and various amounts of thought reading. These subjects will need more combat training to be effective and to stand out on their own but will suffice as lower class operatives at this point in time.\n\n*Subject Dossiers*\n\nSubject Name: The Twin\n\nReal Name: Redacted\n\nAge: 17\n\nHistory: Taken from a poor Japanese family with too many children, the Twin and his brother showed immediate progress and led the pack for the majority of the project.\n\nPowers/Abilities: Thought projection, sense, the ability to summon small items in large quantities, the ability to summon a doppleganger persona.\n\nOp Name: Conjurer\n\nAdditional Info: Conjurer seems to use his doppleganger as a means of staying out of harms way and for offensive purposes.

I have supplied 18 new operatives of various skill sets, The Thrall, and perhaps the young boy can even be used in the future after he's matured a bit. I've also made serious headway in to a previously unknown field. The applications of Tulpa had been theorized but not put in to effect. I have shown that Tulpa can be weaponized, it can be used defensively, it can be utilized. As with my previous projects the operatives will be out of my hands and control now. Perhaps I will lead a more detailed study of The Thrall next, but right now it's time to pat myself on the back and rest.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSecrets here, kinda interesting to see another project Case File with Dr. Marlowe. His work is as fascinating as it is morally ambiguous. \n\nSo the concept of Tulpa is actually something I'm a tad knowledgable about. This is the first time in the Case Files that I'm acquainted with the subject matter so let me tell you what I know personally. I originally found out about Tulpa through an old creepypasta floating around the web. I was curious as always so I looked in to it further to find that Tulpa is actually a real thing. It's a major part of the Buddhist religion as well as a core concept for Western religion. My mum is even a follower of something called The Law of Attraction which states that if you believe good things will come your way then you start to attract those things to you. Any more discussion about what I know and believe about Tulpa can be handled in the comments with you fine folk.\n\nNext up is the Q and A. Tattle promised answers that would come along with Case File 10 so if you have questions I'd submit them now. I have no idea how Tattle plans to do this, maybe they'll send me a word doc full of answers or edit the Case File after I post it to add in the Q and A. I dunno.\n\nMy question for Tattle is this: Why this particular order for the files? You've teased us with Earth-A, Hoffer, Jack, hints of The Lightning Man in places, E-byss, and more. A lot of unresolved plot is here and while it's interesting it's also maddening. Is there more in the Case Files that continues the stories of the various entities and people that we've already been introduced to?\n\nAnyway, I'm glad that you have kept the Case Files going strong, I shudder to think what Tattle could do with me if they thought I was useless. I'll continue posting as long as people keep wanting so stay safe NoSleep."

        "body": "Well, Secrets here and to my amazement my next post is not Case File Ten and the Q and A. I've started writing it out but am still holding out for a few days to allow people to post questions.\n\nWhat I do have for you today is something I found when I went to close my girlfriend's laptop.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\nIt's not uncommon to wonder about what your neighbors spend their time doing. Do they stay home and watch television all day? Do they go out and party at ungodly hours of the night? To have such curiosity about the people that you see ever day or people that you rarely see leave their home is a normalcy among neighbors. Sometimes, when one does rarely see their neighbor, they can have dark thoughts. Perhaps their neighbor uses black magic, or commits homicide. Silly, yes, but it is true. One's thoughts can get creative when they are faced with the unknown. \n\nI have recently moved from my residence of 18 years to an apartment complex close to the school I will be attending. When my boyfriend and I arrived our first impression of our living space was less than satisfactory, mediocre doesn't even describe it. The first week here was spent replacing floors, cleaning windows, and resurfacing counters. It's not what we had planned to spend our time doing, but it had to be done so that instead of living in a literal shit hole we could have a mediocre place to store our belongings. After everything was settled and we unpacked the few things we could, we spent some time getting a lay of the land. Here and there we would see our neighbors across the hall and next door leaving their apartments to get on with their daily doings. A \"Hello,\" or \"Good morning,\" would be passed on but usually just a passing nod would suffice.\n\nLife went on for about a week with no real goings-on or events. My boyfriend and I spent most of our remaining free time playing games and lounging around before I started class the following week. I had never really paid any attention to our upstairs neighbor before because we had been too busy to hear them. So, as I sat on the couch I heard them walking around and I realized then that I had never actually seen them leave or enter the apartment. I gave it no more thought since there was really no reason to. I just assumed they were a student, such as myself, and I had just always missed them.\n\nI woke up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat thanks to a nightmare. As I lay trying to coax myself back to sleep I began to hear an unnatural noise. It was a scratching noise, but the noise itself seemed to be scratching the inside of my skull. I tried to ignore it and get some sleep, for I had an early class and I was getting quite frustrated that I was awake at all. The scratching just got louder and clearer, it seemed to be coming from the ceiling directly above me. For a moment I became very unnerved, until I remembered seeing a mouse hole in the kitchen. I wrote it off as nothing more than some mice and I decided that I needed to invest in some traps. In the morning I was relieved to find evidence of mice currently keeping a residence in the apartment. I laughed at myself for feeling the need to be relieved and for getting so unnerved that past night.\n\nAfter class I was home alone because my boyfriend was out and about applying for local jobs. I decided to put on some music and do a bit of drawing since I hadn't done much of that post-move. I had just gotten into my \"groove\" when I heard a noise coming from upstairs. Under the music it was quite muffled and it didn't bother me to an extent where I had to turn up my music. The muffled noise from above startled me the second time for it was almost deliberately louder. I listened for it again while turning down the music and slowing my breath. The sound I heard gave me chills. It was a scraping sound, like when a child drags a chair across hardwood floors. The sound was painful though, as if I had just unknowingly ground my teeth together.  I don't know for how long I sat motionless listening to that sound, for the next thing I knew my boyfriend was in the doorway asking me if I was feeling well. I said that I was fine, because at that moment I was. Nothing was wrong, no pain, no deafening noise, nothing but my quiet music and his concerned words. He told me that I just looked awfully pale and that maybe I should rest. Instead, I convinced him that I was just really hungry and that I was having cramps.\n\nTo my dismay I woke in the middle of the night again, not to a nightmare, but to that scratching noise. I could hear it so clearly that I wondered nervously if it really was coming from the ceiling above me. I became so engulfed in the noise that I did not move a muscle, like a small child who heard a bump in the night and is stowed away under their covers hoping the monsters will go away. The scratching became louder and louder, booming inside of my skull. Every scratch pulsed in my head like a migraine, but there was no true pain, just the deafening noise of fingernails on a chalkboard. Or more accurately, fingernails scraping the inside of a skull. My skull.\n\nThe sun was shining in my retinas through my eyelids when I was conscious again. I must have fallen asleep because the last thing I remember was that awful noise. \n\nWhile I was eating my breakfast, I asked my boyfriend if he'd heard our upstairs neighbor. He said he has heard, on many occasions, the sounds of heavy footsteps just walking around. He then added that he had in fact never seen them before, and asked why I was inquiring and if I had seen them. I told him that I had been hearing some weird noises and that I had not seen him either. We threw some pretty wild ideas to each other, being horror fanatics we mused over the idea of him being some psycho-killer. We laughed about it, though, on my way to class that day I felt great trepidation about our unknown \"friend\".\n\nAfter class I came home just as my boyfriend was leaving to go to the Target across the street from us. He said he wouldn't be too long, kissed me, said he loved me and left. It had been a really good day so I was feeling like I needed to kick some butt in some fighting game. I popped in Soul Calibur 2 to restart the game, got myself some Mtn. Dew, and cozzied up on the couch. Just as I had done so I heard heavy footsteps from upstairs. I froze and was covered in goosebumps as I listened to the steps walk from the door, to the bedroom, and back. Pacing back and forth the person who resides above me seemed to be hastening their step. Abruptly it stopped and I couldn't tell in which room they had stopped in. I didn't really care what room it was. I had wanted to be relieved that the pacing stopped, but I wasn't. I felt so terrified for no apparent reason at all. \n\nThen the scratching started. I jolted my head around to look at my bedroom. There was no mistake that it was indeed coming from the bedroom. The sound was already eating its way into my skull. Oh, that awful noise! I sprang from the couch determined to find the source and make it stop. I jumped up on the bed and started to pound on the ceiling. It was driving me insane. The sound was literally driving me insane. My hand started to throb, and well after the sound had actually stopped I was still pounding the ceiling. I collapsed onto the bed and was awoken by my boyfriend asking, jokingly, if I had a rough day. I tried to conjure a laugh and say that I must have been really tired. I could tell that he didn't truly buy it, but he didn't ask any questions. \n\nAt dinner I told him that while he was gone I heard an odd scratching noise coming from over our bed. To my utter relief he told me that he had heard it too. I had thought that perhaps I was going crazy, so when he said that I was just too happy to continue the conversation.\n\nDirt. I was woken up by the feeling of dirt falling softly on my face. It startled me enough to make me jolt upright from the bed. I rubbed my face and felt nothing. I sighed, thinking that I truly am going crazy. As I laid back down I looked up at the ceiling, and was frozen in place. Directly above me in the dark I could make out two small holes, and in those holes I saw the glinting of two menacing, deep, eyes staring at me. The scratching started, already in my head and loud as ever. My upstairs neighbor was scratching into my ceiling, bits of it were falling onto my face. The scratching, oh that scratching, made my head pound. I couldn't hear anything but that scratching.\n\nThose eyes looked through those scratched holes into my eyes. \n\nI woke up late, my boyfriend left me a note saying he had a job interview and that he had bought me some cold medicine explaining that I seemed very sick. \n\nI threw on some clothes and bolted out of the door. I had enough. I stormed up the stairs and pounded on the door. There was no answer. I pounded on the door again and was startled to hear a reply. It wasn't from inside the apartment, but from behind me. I turned to see a slender looking girl with long caramel hair, and brown eyes asking me what I was doing. I sheepishly asked her if she lived here, feeling very foolish. She said yes and asked me if there was something wrong. Calming myself down I decided to just ask her if she was attending a school in the area. She smiled and said that she was. She'd be starting in a couple of weeks. Today was the day she was moving into the apartment above me.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nA little explanation for you: My girlfriend writes out anything scary or traumatic in her life. If she has a scary dream it suddenly becomes a little short story of hers. Her mood dips a bit? She'll write about it.\n\nI've confronted her about this and she tried to play it off like a story but she's opened up about it and I have in turn opened up about what the Case Files really are.\n\nThe noises upstairs have stopped and the girl upstairs complained about the holes to the head office. They were patched up this morning and were attributed to an animal loose in the building.\n\nSo...I believe this is my first encounter with an entity, and I have yet to actually see it.\n\nI'd say that I'd move away but we're signed on for a year, dirt poor, and my girlfriend really needs to focus on school and whatnot. I'll be installing some extra security measures but I guess I'm kinda taking a risk here. Keep us safe Tattle...or I swear to God..\n\nStay safe NoSleep."

        "title": "Case File #10 The Pen of Grimoria + More",
        "body": "*Case File: 009-153*\n\n*Case File Date: 09/5/2000*\n\n*Location: Cherry Brook, Minnesota*\n\n*Subject: Abigail Hartel*\n\n*Entity: The Pen of Grimoria*\n\n*The following report comes from the relevant parts of the diary of Abigail Hartel.*\n\n*09/5/00*\n\nSchool has just started and I'm already having all the problems I had last year, it's just not fair! Tiffany Albright wasted no time berating my appearance. She knows about Dad's illness, she knows how costly it is for us. Yet she's still the one calling me out on my Walmart clothes, lack of makeup, and less than perfect social skills.\n\nI was really just hoping to turn my junior year around...make a few friends, avoid drama, maybe meet a cute guy. But I was wrong. It's going to be the same as last year and the years before it. I'm going to be the girl they pick on and abuse. I'm tired, going to bed.\n\nSigning off alone, Abby.\n\n*09/7/00*\n\nSo I met a boy today! Well, kinda. He's a new kid, Chad. Tiffany had been pushing me around at my locker and had removed my hairband to step on it. Gram gave me that headband a few years ago and I was in tears because Tiffany was going to break it.\n\nShe tossed it on the ground and lifted her foot to crush it and suddenly the headband wasn't there. Turns out Chad had saw the whole thing play out and slid by to snatch the headband. He then told Tiffany to stop being a bitch and gave me my headband back.\n\nHe left saying he'd see me around and left. God he was cute, tall, shaggy black hair, big blue eyes. And Tiffany didn't come anywhere near me the rest if the day and most of the kids didn't even stare at me or laugh like usual.\n\nSigning off with hope, Abby.\n\n*09/10/00*\n\nAs I mentioned in yesterday's entry, Chad and I had a little mini-date today. We walked around town for a bit, snagged some food, and then he showed me the antique shop his family had just opened in town. It was a pretty cool place. They had so much elegant stuff like clothes and fancy looking paintings. \n\nI had told Chad about my desire to write books someday and I saw his face light up. He told me to wait a second and went into the back room. He came back with an old looking box. \n\nInside was the most beautiful quill pen I've ever seen. It's some kind of polished wood, stained black. There are weird marking etched the whole way down the side. In certain places the markings have gemstones in them.\n\nChad gave me it along with a bottle of ink. He said that his family had that pen in the store for awhile now and it wasn't selling and so he gave it to me. He told me that the pen was specially made a long time ago for someone important and that anything I wrote in the pen was supposed to come true. He then joked that I should write about us having a better date. Cutie.\n\nSuch a good day, this is going to be such a good year.\n\nEver jubilant, Abby.\n\n*09/14/00*\n\nI had more trouble with Tiffany today. Mom had bought me a new outfit because Dad's health was turning around and it looks like he might get better. So we went out and she bought me a nice top and skirt to celebrate. \n\nWell, Tiffany didn't like that I was wearing nice clothes and pointed out that I was wearing something nice while Dad was sick. I tried to explain to her that he was making a recovery but she yelled at me saying people don't get better from what Dad had...I ran out of the hallway bawling and spent most of the day in the Guidance Counselor's Office. Chad was also not at school so I couldn't see him.\n\n*I want Dad to get better, then Tiffany will be so wrong and the other kids won't think anything bad of me.*\n\n*With much hope that this stupid little pen works, Abby.*\n\n*09/15/00*\n\nIt worked! Holy crap, I can't believe it worked! The hospital called us this morning and said that Dad's condition was a full turn around. He is 100% better and they claim it's a miracle. I got to skip school to spend the day with Dad and wow, just wow. He looked better, acted better, he was better. This pen may have saved his life.\n\nI can't wait to thank Chad for this gift. I wonder if he actually knew that the pen worked? I'll have to ask him at school on Monday. Right now I'm just beyond happy to have helped Dad.\n\nHaving a great day, Abby.\n\n*09/16/00*\n\nDad...took a turn for the worst over the night and passed away. Doctor's said that there was something they hadn't seen and for whatever reason his previous illness was actually keeping it in check. Without his disease this new condition seems to have killed him. I killed him...\n\n*09/17/00*\n*Scrawled hastily over the page.*\n\nDad's dead. My fault.\n\n*09/18/00*\n\nToday was horrible. Tiffany brought up what I said about Dad getting better and then had some of her friends gang up on me. They yelled at me for getting nice things while Dad was on his deathbed and said there was a level of hell reserved for bitches like me...I think I know what to do.\n\n*I want these girls to go away. I want them to feel the pain they've caused me.*\n\n*I'm tired...sleeping now.*\n\n*09/20/00*\n\nTiffany and her friends didn't show up at school yesterday...I found out today that someone snuck in to their houses and killed them and their fathers. Apparently the bodies were in really bad condition and one of the moms had to be restrained so she wouldn't kill herself.\n\nThe only reason I found all this out is because I'm the main suspect right now. The police interviewed me after talking to some of the other kids at school and learning that the girls picked on me after Dad died. I didn't want them to die, or for their fathers to die...I just wanted them to leave me alone. This stupid pen is messing everything up. I'm going to find Chad tomorrow, I still haven't seen him.\n\nScared and alone, Abby.\n\n*09/21/00*\n\nChad's gone. \n\nI skipped school to check out his family's antique shop and the building with empty with a \"For Rent\" in the window. Where did they go? I need to find out. I get a feeling Chad knew more about the pen than he let on. I'm going to try something now and see if it works.\n\n*Bring Chad back to me.*\n\nAbby.\n\n*09/28/00*\n\nIt's been a week. Chad isn't here which makes me think he did know about the pen and has someway of making it not work. Or maybe the pen isn't working for some reason. I don't understand it. I don't know enough.\n\nI'm not welcomed at school anymore either. Students started harassing me really bad because they believe I killed the others. I mean, I guess I did but it was an accident! I never wanted them to die. Seems unfair to blame me for not thinking about the wording.\n\nI guess they wanna talk to me in a couple days but I don't think I can let them. They'll just assume it was me since no one can really confirm that I was sleeping during all that except me. So...I hate that I have to do this.\n\n*The police station is going to close down.*\n\n*Freaking out a bit, Abby.*\n\n*09/29/00*\n\nThe police station is gone. There was a gas leak leak under the building and it apparently exploded, killing most of the officers on duty. I killed those men and women.\n\nI think I know what I have to do now. I have to find Chad, he or his family must have planned this and I need to find out why they chose me and stop them from doing it someone else.\n\nMom, if you find my journal and read this then know that I am sorry. I tried to be a good daughter, I tried to help Dad. Then I just wanted to hide away from the people who were hurting me. Things are different now, I'm a little different now. I don't want to hide from the problem, I want to find answers to the questions that I now have. And maybe I'll get lucky...maybe Chad's family has other weird items that I can use to fix this.\n\nI love you so much. I may send you some letters from time to time if I actually get somewhere with this.\n\n*Point me in the right direction to find the answers I seek.*\n\n*Signing off with much conviction, Abby.*\n\n*Analysis: Abigail Hartel was the daughter of Agent Cameron Hartel. Agent Hartel was being treated for a disease he had received from an entity attack. News of his sudden recovery and then unexplained death started an investigation in to him and his family. Abigail's diary entries were found within several days of her leaving. We were aware that someone or something was spreading various artifacts across the United States, we now know that this Chad and his family are what we're looking for. Agents have been sent out to find and track Abigail.*\n\n*As for her quill, we believe that it is the Pen of Grimoria. The pen was crafted through a mixture of pagan witchcraft and consorting with demonic beings. It was created for a powerful being that led a cadre of witches and pagan followers during medieval times. The pen can make whatever is written by it become reality, however it will often twist the request if there is little to no bloodshed. Certain measures can also be taken to become immune to the pen's effects. Capturing the Pen of Grimoria is being added to our list of priorities.*\n\n*Case File: Unresolved.*\n\nSecrets is once again not here. I thought I'd do him a favor and save him the work of typing out Case File Ten, and now the Case File has passed so on to what many of you are waiting for. I'll be starting with Secrets' question first and will then delve it to the other questions. I'll also be italicizing my responses just to make them stand out a bit more, hospitality is key after all.\n\n\"Why this particular order for the files? You've teased us with Earth-A, Hoffer, Jack, hints of The Lightning Man in places, E-byss, and more. A lot of unresolved plot is here and while it's interesting it's also maddening. Is there more in the Case Files that continues the stories of the various entities and people that we've already been introduced to?\"\n\n*The answer Secrets, is that I am an author, you are a narrator, and NoSleep is the audience. I would like you and Nosleep to think of Case Files 1-10 as a sort of...Season One. I've teased you all with many entities and people with little continuation or conclusion. I will still be introducing entities but will now be continuing the stories of things you've already been introduced to. Hope you enjoy.*\n\n\"Will we get to see Organization 440 capture famous creatures like a Japanese demon or the Midnight Man?\"\n\n*Are you sure you want to know these beings are real...or is it more safe to believe they are fiction?*\n\n\"My question is... WHO IS HOFFER!!?\"\n\n*Who is he indeed..?*\n\n\"What is Hoffer's true goal?\"\n\n*To climb the career ladder.*\n\n\"What exactly is a 'Stalker'? I know you mentioned it in the Hastings' Report, but I wanted to know what it was.\"\n\n*The best description of a Stalker is in Case File Four. Doctor Marlowe's description is the best you're going to find. I will say that there are now 'Generations' of Stalkers though.*\n\n\"Did Organization 440 create what are known as 'Rakes' due to the Hysteria Project?\"\n\n*No. That was a different Project.*\n\n\"What exactly is a 'Lightning Man'? Is it some Lightning based invincible zombie?\"\n\n*A being from another dimension. Unfortunately Organization 440 had spend most of their time containing it instead of researching it so they never learned much. They did learn that it keeps sections of its corporeal being in different planes of existence at the same time which render it \"invincible\". I also know that it is not undead and if all of the entity is brought in to a singular plane it can be killed.*\n\n\"I have a little question for Tattle as well, Tattle, are these 'super' soldiers still active now? I mean they weren't made too long ago I suppose, but are they still working for O-440?\"\n\n*The ones that were not utterly destroyed or holding secret agendas do indeed still work for Organization 440...in various capacities.*\n\n\"My question is very insignificant, but what is Organization 440's definition of a god? I believe I have seen Volos and the boys entity referenced as 'gods' and I was just wondering what they mean.\"\n\n*Volos was called a God because he quite literally is a God. Well, a dead one. As for the term God I believe they use it to describe any being that has deity-like powers, enough similarities with actions the Biblical God could perform, or that can significantly alter/change reality.*\n\n\"Please ask Tattle if he knows who the boy is and how old he is now and if he still lives a normal life.\"\n\n*I am well aware of who he is. Twenty-one years old. He is normal enough while he's awake.*\n\n\"Has any of the subjects from the Tulpa Project or the Hysteria Project been sent out on missions? If so, is there a case file about a mission with one of the subjects that can be posted online??\"\n\n*There have been many missions and you will get to read them in due time. How exciting.*\n\n\"I also have a question, if it's not too late: what is the Ether? I believe it was mentioned in one of the earlier cases.\"\n\n*Ether and E-Particles are similar to P-Particles in that some entities are comprised of it and seem to use it for their powers. Ether is not native to Earth and the best that I can describe it to you is to take a chemical compound that does not currently exist on Earth and anything that is made up of that compound gains abilities.*\n\n\"What are P-Particles? I want a scientific explanation and how they can be detected.\"\n\n*P-Particles are the boringly named Paranormal Particles. These were the compounds found in the genetic structure of the very first entities killed and studied by Organization 440. Take everything I just said about Ether and apply it to P-Particles. Also to note is that Ether comes from one dimension and P-Particles from an entirely different dimension, sort of like different biomes breed different animals. As for how they are detected it's much like radiation, these are particles that should not be in our world and they stand right out if you have the right technology.*\n\n\"Would it be possible for you to tell us some of what you know about this \"dimension\" (or whatever) that these entities are coming from, and maybe some things about the entities themselves?\"\n\n*As a continuation of the previous two questions I will say that E-byss is an entity that comes from the Ether-based dimension. The Lightning Man, The Man in the Corner, and Omega come from the P-Particle dimension. Volos is from an undetermined dimension. Jack is...complicated. Tulpa and anything created by Tulpa seems to be rooted in this dimension. Earth-A is a parallel dimension that intersects with this one at times allowing one to transport across it or for things to spill from one plane to another.*\n\n\"Is the entity Jack from your post actually Jack the Ripper?\"\n\n*He's a lot of things and Jack the Ripper is one of them.*\n\n\"For the Mannequins, I'm curious to know if, because they're dead, are they rotting? Or something like losing pigment color into a grey? As I look back, it seems that they are nearly invulnerable, as only fire can kill them. I guess another question to ask would be are the Mannequins advanced zombies? It would be interesting if a military got ahold of this sort of knowledge and created an army of these...\"\n\n*Mannequins defy all 'conventional' thought on the undead. They possess the ability to withstand physical punishment and burn up like the undead but the body itself seems to preserve itself to what it looked like at the time of death. There is no decay, no rotting skin. I would call them more of a fusion of zombie and ghost than an advanced zombie.*\n\n\"Are all entities discovered by these groups all 'evil?'\" \n\n*Not at all. Angels, benevolent spirits and gods, entities that actually wish to help humans...they all exist.*\n\n\"What are the chances that a normal person could survive an attack from an entity?\"\n\n*Depends on the entity. The Man in the Corner uses traps for instance. Once you are in its trap you are almost guaranteed death. But it only attacks people who enter its current haunt. Avoid the building, avoid the danger. E-byss and the Lightning Man have never been escaped from to my knowledge. Not permanently at least. Volos will corrupt and kill when it can. Jack has been sloppy in the past and let people get away but...well, he's had a lot of time to perfect his craft. The more intelligent operatives will not always kill. The basic rule of thumb is that you don't want to meet an entity. Ever.*\n\n\"What was it that attacked Secrets? As far as I knew, there was no known entity, or weapon for that matter, that was capable of such \"mind altering\" attacks without some form of bodily damage.\"\n\n*I've been looking in to it and I believe the reason both you and I can't pinpoint the technology is because it isn't from this dimension. I suspect it is Earth-A Organization 440. And if you're wondering why they would do this then I'll mention that Earth-A 440 and myself have had...hostile engagements in the past.*\n\n\"I want a list on how to combat entities that are paranormal. I realize this can be a long list. We have some information on how 440 combats certain entities... but so far it isn't very much. Share the knowledge you have, tell us if holy water and salt is bs and only has the power we believe it to have or just has no power at all. Or something no one knows. i want to know how to combat and even approach and engage entities. I want a list of all major types of entities and what to watch out for how to hurt them, which ones are to just stay away from because you dont have the info but know they will fuck you up if you encounter them. We are on case file number 8 and I will be an old man before reading through all the files when they are eventually posted. I would like a run down of all entities and their powers and weaknesses to your knowledge, like in the most recent case file they mentioned electric entities are weakened by magnetic bullets.\"\n\n*To cut down the list by a large degree I will advise you to get in to folklore, fairy tales, legends, mythology, and the like. Stories about minotaurs, nymphs, fairies, demons, devils, etc. are all based on actual entities. The ways to combat them are often correct as well. My advice is to use your brain, if you encounter something that shoots fire then douse it in water. I will issue a large degree of caution with entities that have teleportation powers. Often these entities are incapable of being harmed on our plane of existence and you're better off running. Same goes with god-like beings. As for the bulk of your question, it would require a lot of time on my part to answer it fully. I'll begin compiling information now to reveal at a later date.*\n\n\"Tattle, what the actual fuck is going on?\"\n\n*A story. A war. Game of Thrones shit. But very little fucking to my regret.*\n\nWhy? Is there are particular point that this is finally being divulged now? Or do you have an another motive besides divulging information Tattle? Also, for my perverted curiosity: Boxers or Briefs?\n\n*I had to wait for Secrets to become the man he is today. Also, boxer briefs. Survive one night locked in a house with me and I may even let you paint me like one of your french girls...dirty man.*\n\n\"Is Secrets in danger, are you in danger?\"\n\n*Everyone is always in danger. Secrets is in slightly more danger than most of you but I assure you his chances of turning up dead tomorrow are slim. I'm quite safe though, thanks for asking.*\n\n\"Given the effort that somebody or something went through to 'wipe his memory', and given the possibility that you didn't do it to him, and especially now that you've made an appearance of sorts, this implies that the someone or something is aware of your actions and doesn't agree with your goals. Whatever did this to Secrets, whether good or evil, should have without a doubt did the same to you. Or for that matter, will do the same to both of you the next time around. How can you protect him in this case, how do we know you can protect yourself if you don't know how it happened in the first place? Do you think you might be forgetting something important?\"\n\n*I'm completely sure that there is nothing in this dimension that knows about Secrets. Unfortunately I did not anticipate that an old enemy might make an appearance. If the culprit is Earth-A Organization 440 like I think then the new measures I have put in place will protect him. If I'm wrong and it's something else then the other measure I put in place will protect him. As for how I'll protect him, my plan is to kill anyone and anything that gets near him. Simple and effective. And my memory is just fine thank you.*\n\n\"What is your purpose, Tattle?\"\n\n*Same as anyone else's, to live. To exist.*\n\n\"Are you even to be trusted?\"\n\n*Are you?*\n\n\"Were you part of any testing?\"\n\n*No.*\n\n\"Tattle, are you the kid that escaped from the hysteria project??\"\n\n*I am not.*\n\n\"Did you work in any of these projects?\"\n\n*No.*\n\n\"I like how your and Secrets's names are opposites (a tattle tale is someone who spills a secret), and Tattle have you had contact/are you the meta-human from the hysteria project/can you guarantee Secrets protection and if yes, how?\"\n\n*I thought I was pretty witty choosing my name, glad you agree. I've personally seen some of the operatives you've mentioned but am not one. And my plan to protect Secrets is to keep him hidden. Failing that I plan to kill.*\n\n\"Can you or Secrets use Tulpa as explained in case file #9 or any other ways?\"\n\n*Technically anyone can use Tulpa with enough focus. Neither Secrets or myself are adept with it however.*\n\n\"Tattle, are you an entity or a regular human, or not quite either? I'm wondering this because Secrets was attacked by an entity and you were able to stop it. Not to mention saying that any entity going after Secrets would end up dead. So, in my mind you either have access to Organization 440's technology, you are entity, or are a part of some of the human experiments done bt Organization 440.\"\n\n*One of the three ideas in your mind is correct. Have fun figuring it out.*\n\n\"I know you have no idea who I am, seeing as how I only know of the 440 through a second-hand account, but I am curious as to how you play into all of this. What are you? An experiment gone wrong? Gone rouge? A pissed of professor/captive/merc with a grudge? Everyone with anything to do with 440 has some form of grudge to hold.\"\n\n*I'm complicated. And I do have a grudge. I advise you to avoid whoever gave you information. I don't like loose ends unless I can control them.*\n\n\"What is your role in all of this? Have you any affiliation with Organization 440? Are you helping Secrets?\"\n\n*My role is to be the author of this tale. I am indeed affiliated with Organization 440 in some way, shape, or form...most likely anger. And it would be more accurate to say that Secrets is helping me.*\n\n\"What do you gain from protecting Secrets, and from having him telling us these case files?\"\n\n*Revenge.*\n\n\"Are you a part of Secrets psyche? Are you another embodiment of Secrets that is related with 440 and are you keeping them at bay? Are you here to keep him safe...or are you a danger simply toying with his life?\"\n\n*You've hit a grain of truth in your question-guesses. As for me I am entirely separate from Secrets and I do not want him to die.*\n\n\"Tattle, it seems that you have some in-depth knowledge on these cases. Is it because you were one of the subjects being tested or were you one of the researchers? If either of these is the case, how are you free now to help Secrets publish these files? What measures are you taking to protect yourself? Is the organization still out there?\"\n\n*I'm afraid I am neither a subject or a researcher. I assure you that the measures I have in place will keep me around for a long, long time.*\n\n\"Why Secrets? The files were put there by someone (assuming they were you) and later removed after he found them, because I searched for hours and couldn't find so much as a trace.\"\n\n*I am indeed the one who planted the files where he could find them. As for why I chose him it was simply a matter of familiarity and sentimentality.*\n\n\"The main thing I want to know from Tattle is... why tell us? The random strangers on the internet?\"\n\n*Because everyone likes a show.*\n\n\"With all the information that is being thrown at us...What would you have us do with it? It seems to me we are rather powerless against such overwhelming odds. Also, cake or pie?\"\n\n*Store it, remember it, share it. Just acknowledge it for now.*\n\n*Also, pie.*\n\n\"Who's the man behind ''Tattle''? Are you Secrets from Earth-A? After analyzing and going through much of the info in the case file it seems you're not from this world. How do you know all of this? I understand that there are case files and such and maybe you read through them all, but you seem to know more. Things you may be hiding from us now.\"\n\n*Who said I was a man? And I'm not Secrets in any way, I promise you that. Keep secrets? Me? Surely you jest.*\n\n\"Are you from our plane of existence and time frame?\"\n\n*Now you're getting to the heart of it. No.*\n\n\"What's with Earth-A?\"\n\n*A lot in fact.*\n\n\"Question for Tattle also involving Earth and Earth-A, what version are we in right now and does Secrets have anything to do with org 440 in teh other version? Is that why he chose Secrets?\"\n\n*We are in plain, old Earth right now. Also, to this version of Secrets' probable regret, the answer is yes. His Earth-A counterpart did have something to do with Earth-A Organization 440.*\n\n\"Given what we know about O440 etc. etc., they clearly have paranormal / supernatural / mutant beings under some sort of control and have the necessary control over their willpower (in some cases) that O440 can tell their test subjects what to do. It seems like they're building a mass army of super beings in a control environment much like Walter Bishop and William Bell did in the TV show Fringe. First question, why? I understand that defending ourselves against other super-beings makes sense - but if it was really, truly necessary I think we as a species would know. So what gives?\n\nWith such power and control, it would also seem insane to think that the kind of information we're seeing here could just \"leak\". Someone must know about it, and I think that someone is you, Tattle. It seems a bit silly to state that, but from the viewpoint of the reader, I see you as the instigator. To me, you're someone with a hidden motive. The most morally straight person who wants to do good with knowledge like this would not just freely release this information publicly. This leads me to think that O440, and you, need people. The right people. People with open and malleable minds to use as successful subjects. In that case, it wouldn't make any sense to just tell everyone about O440, you would need an appropriate filter. Are we (the nosleep audience) test subjects in another experiment? Is O440 using this \"leak\" as a talent scout of sorts? Are you using these case files to attract us and then using your current subjects' abilities or other methods to find us? It's not like any individual reader here would know if another reader disappeared.\n\nI hope that last bit makes everyone reading these cases really think about just what this organization is actually doing. A lot of people seem to trust Tattle in some form or another because the person is adding to an already rich series of posts in a big way. This organization appears to feel the need to defend us, and more importantly defend themselves. They'll take people at random from anywhere at any time if it suits their needs. I could be totally 100% right about all of this and disappear tomorrow, and I doubt very much that anyone here would notice. Creepy, right? \n\nEdit: Also, I forgot to ask. Can the girl who supposedly alter gravity fly yet? And is she single? As you can clearly see, I ask the tough, sensitive and hard-hitting questions.\"\n\n*Does war have to be noble? Does Organization 440 have to tell anyone what they are doing? No. Secret things happen all the time. Selfish, secret things. As for your little...conspiracy theory, why confront me? I'll admit that I could track you down and do a great many things to you but I honestly have little desire to hurt you. And for your most important question...the last time I saw Dreamer she was missing half her skull, an arm, and her bottom half. I may have had something to do with it. Want me to set up a date?*\n\n\"If the O-440 is still around, do they know of any current threats to the US, and if yes, where would they be?\"\n\n*There are threats everywhere. Threats from humans, threats from different dimensions, threats from time...*\n\n\"Does 440 know about Secrets?\"\n\n*Negative.*\n\n\"I've looked pretty hard into organization 440 without luck. Is there a secret to it?\"\n\n*Yes, go find an entity. The Organization won't be too far behind.*\n\n\"Is 440 planning or engaging with Earth-A or the Earth-A version of 440?\"\n\n*Wouldn't that be rather ambitious of them?*\n\n\"Is anything worth mentioning going on within 440 right now that you know of? Most of these case files are pretty dated, and it would be nice to know what they're up to as of late.\"\n\n*Something rather severe happened a few years ago...I'll be sharing it with you soon.*\n\n\"Just what exactly is organization 440's purpose?\"\n\n*To study the unknown, and to protect the United States from it.*\n\n\"How does Organization 440 go about recruiting people?\"\n\n*Often times they will offer jobs to people from the more large scale entity confrontations. I believe a fifth of the population of Rainston was recruited the day they airlifted The Villier House away. Other times they'll pick up mercenaries, washed up people from various fields, or the best and brightest if they can be persuaded.*\n\n\"Is 440 in anyway linked or related to 'Nightmare Hall' in the alleged Dulce facility? If so, (and if you can answer) why the need for human experimentation/cross species breeding?\"\n\n*Different government run program.*\n\n\"How often does this organization bribe or use other means to keep people quiet? It must have a large amount of funding to be keeping it a secret. And when you finally do \"Tattle\" on them, will you be going to the main media sources? Or are they bribed as well? Finally, do you like waffles?\"\n\n*Depends on who is running the mission, but most of the people in charge would prefer minimal casualties. Organization 440 still takes a significant amount of money from the United States' coffers. I'll also mention that the Organization owns more than one large corporation. You've got me all wrong by the way. I've already tattled on them. To you. I have no intention to spread this information any further than where you are willing to share it. I can enjoy a good stack of waffles if the mood is right.*\n\n\"I just have to ask though, what is organization 440? are they still around? is it all based in America?\"\n\n*The Organization is a government funded group formed a rather long time ago to combat the paranormal. They are based in the United States but will perform operations outside of it. They are still around in some capacity.*\n\n\"I'm sort of curious to know what type of branch of military/science this is, and how do they pick the subjects?\"\n\n*Technically it is not a military or science branch of the government. Think more along the lines of the CIA or FBI...and then make them a step more secretive. As for the subjects, many are chosen because of unique life experiences, certain backgrounds, or various health issues. If a project lead feels that a certain type of subject is needed for testing then they will be brought in. Beyond that they'll also use volunteers from within the Organization.*\n\n\"Not sure if this has been asked, but here goes. Tattle, would you happen to know the origins/history of Organization 440 and the Zones, as well as the names of any key people involved? How are these groups being funded?\"\n\n*I know the Organization was founded under a different name sometime in the 1800's. The term Organization 440 starts to appear around the late 40's. As for a key person involved...well, Hoffer, Hastings, a shadowy elite group of men that I'm not privy to, and the most prominent researchers. The Zones are a bit more difficult for me to gather information on. I have absolutely no idea when each individual European nation founded their own Paranormal Branch but the overall founding of The Zones occurred sometime in the 1970's. Germany and The United Kingdom appear to be the leading Zones. As for funding, Organization 440 siphons money out of the United States Treasury as well as owning several large scale corporations. The Zones are entirely government funded at this point.*\n\n\"How many cells of Organization 440 are there around the world and where are their main centers? What is Organization 440 preparing for? There are quite a few projects that have been developing that will give them strong soldiers. I find that nations only do that when they fear a war. How does the organisation work? How do they chose their researchers and such?\"\n\n*I am not sure of the exact number of cells. It could be as low as seven and as high as forty. The Organization's bases are all located in the United States. I believe Organization 440 was preparing with an eventual clash with The Zones, Omega, Earth-A, or some other large scale enemy. The Organization works much like a cross between the military and a business. Researcher recruitment varies between each individual but often times the Organization will single out up and coming young researchers and offer them lucrative amounts of money in exchange for a life contract.*\n\nAnd that's what I've chosen to answer in this initial Q and A. Want to chat? You have twelve hours till Secrets will be able to check this again. Make your conversations with me count. Or don't. I also enjoy the witless banter. \n\nI also have another topic to chime in on. Secrets asked a question back in Case File 5 and here's my answer: get help and start a wiki. Things are starting to get deeper and I know you keep getting frustrated when you have to sift through the Case Files for a grain of information. So...start a wiki for those who want to go further than just read to get in a scared mood. I have ways to protect the site from being discovered so don't worry about that at the very least.\n\nMany of you seem to know of or have entities you wish to read more of. If you start sending requests to Secrets I may honor your request by moving up a Case File containing that entity.\n\nStay wary, and remember NoSleep...no one is safe."

        "body": "I don't actually know what to call this thing. I mean...it seems constructed like a Case File but has no number. You guys wanted to know whenever something weird happened though and I think this counts.\n\n*This account was taken from the subject's cellphone in an unsent text message.*\n\nI'm hiding under my covers right now just like I used to do as a kid. Middle of the night and I'm hoping that I can out wait whatever it is that is in my bathroom. This is all so silly to me, I'm a man of logic not fear or superstition.\n\nLet's go over what I know to see if I can find an explanation. No lights on in my apartment so I'm limited to low-light vision. I sat up in bed, bathroom door is on the wall to my left and the door was left open as usual. From where I sat up I could not see straight on in to my bathroom. It is only after I slid down my bed and centered up with the bathroom that I saw the eyes. The only thing that comes to mind right now is two pin dots of anger. I've seen a cat's or a deer's eyes in the dark before, this was different.\n\nAfter that I dove back under my covers and took a little initiative to snag my phone from the desk beside me. We've now come to a point where I'm as curious as I am scared. An hour or so ago monsters did not exist and I did not question the world. \n\nI laid here for another twenty or so minutes deciding whether I had just seen too many scary movies or if there really was something creepy in my bathroom. Maybe the eyes were just a glint of some light from the blinds or some such. So, I got back up and slowly shimmied down my bed to look in to my bathroom once more. The eyes were still there, I was still getting a nauseous feeling from staring in to them, and yet I couldn't hide just yet. I needed to know that it wasn't just a bit of light catching on some metal. As if to prove a point the eyes moved a bit to the left so that the eyes were straight in front of me and towards the top of the bathroom. They were still angled towards me and I could see concrete proof of both life and intelligence in those pin dots. Back to my covers for I feared that running would provoke and immediate response and I wanted to mull things over.\n\nFive minutes have passed since the last time I've texted in to this phone. I've been going over every bit of horror and monsters that I can think of and I believe I have a theory that I'm unfortunately going to have to test out. I'd bring up loved ones now but I've never really had anyone to love so here goes.\n\nI've removed the covers and am now facing the bathroom door. I was greeted by a blackness and was ready to admit it was in my head when the eyes opened up. Their position is still the same, lined up with me towards the top of the bathroom, looking down at me. I'm raising one hand as high as I can and the left eye disappears. I have moved the hand over and made the right eye disappear. My theory is correct. I'm looking in to the bathroom mir-\n\n*The text message ends.*\n\n*Tattle's Memo: Thought you'd like to see how a Case File looks in an unfinished state. I'd also like to tell you that this took place less than ten miles from you. The Organization will be in the area for a few day so please try not to run down the street proclaiming their downfall or anything of that nature. Now get back to work, people are waiting for Eleven.*\n\nWoke up today with this on my laptop. Door was locked, dog never barked so I don't even want to know how it got there. As for the subject matter, nothing too shocking besides the proximity to me. Seems Tattle is getting impatient with me as well.\n\nAnyway, I've been having the time of my life trying to write out Case File 11. For all the previous Case Files I wrote them out in my web browser on Nosleep. The first time I did this my browser crashed and I lost everything that I had written out. I was pretty pissed and started over in a word doc. Didn't end up saving it and instead left it minimized because Word rarely crashes. Had a brief power outage, lost all my progress again. I'm now plugging through it a third time, saving Word every couple sentences so I am sorry for the delay. A failure is me.\n\nStay safe guys.."

        "title": "Case File #11.1 Room 184",
        "body": "*Case File: 011-300*\n\n*Case File Date: 10/5/1998*\n\n*Location: Detroit, Michigan*\n\n*Subject: Various People*\n\n*Entity: Room 184/The beings within.*\n\n*Interview with Officer Gary Nesbit about Room 184.*\n\nI've been ordered to share what I know regarding the disappearances and murders around Room 184 by my superior. He assures me that you guys handle cases like this and that this is the best way to handle this. I want you to know that I don't trust you secretive FBI/CIA types, too spooky for me. But, I want this thing solved for the people that have gone missing and that have died. I want closure for the friends and family of these people and if you're the best way to get that done then I'll share what I know.\n\nBack in October ten people or groups of people checked in to Room 184 over the span of ten days. All of those people are now missing or dead. This all happened in this dinky little motel on the edge of Detroit located in \"The Rust Belt\". Funny little name that economists coined when some of the factories shut down due to age or lack of use. It's not a great part of town so I'm not sure why people would even choose to stay in a motel there to begin with.\n\nI've been working on Room 184 for the past several months compiling all the info, viewpoints, clues, etc. I've got several eye witness accounts with employees and people in the area, notes left behind by the victims, video cameras that some of the victims had on them, and a set of hidden cameras the owner had set up to peep on female patrons of the motel.\n\n*Day One \u2013 Cedric Howe*\n\nHowe was a struggling author, had some semi-successful book and then wrote a couple flops and was basically black listed in the publishing community. Apparently he was in town to get inspiration for a new book he was writing. \n\nThe head desk said he checked in to Room 184 around two, two thirty in the afternoon and then left for most of the day. We gathered up a few witnesses and found out that he was interviewing young people in the area for research on his book. It was supposed to be some gritty, street book that was supposed to connect with hoodlums or some shit. \n\nHowe returned to Room 184 around eight or nine. The desk clerks said that was the last any of the staff saw of him. The cleaning staff came in the following morning and the room looked like it had hardly been used and assumed Howe had already left.\n\nHowe's body was found ten days later, which is when some of the corpses from Room 184 appeared and the investigation started. Howe was cut clean through from the neck diagonally across his torso. The two halves of his corpse were found in an alley about two miles north of the motel.\n\nOn his person we found a small notebook he had been using for his notes from his interviews. Most of it was just stuff pertaining to his upcoming novel but the last bits of writing are of his final moments alive and are one of the reasons you will be given control of this investigation.\n\n*The final entry in Cedric Howe's notebook.*\n\nI got some good interviews today but I may have found something even better, drugs! The best way to know what it's like to be a drugged out delinquent is to be drugged out myself. I'll keep my book and pen with me and write down everything I see just in case I forget any of this. I'm finally going to get out of this damn hole I'm in.\n\nIt's been like an hour and I haven't seen or felt anything. Is it just not kicking in? Am I immune to drugs? Wait, the light's starting to flicker, maybe this is what I've been waiting for. I'm getting a weird feeling now. It's kinda ominous, like I feel in danger. Probably just because I've never taken drugs before and my psyche or body is freaking out or something. I just need to stay calm and remember what I did.\n\nI think I'm having a bad trip or something. I looked up at my window and it looked like someone was there. I got up to look closer and it looked like a distorted girl? Yeah, distorted seems right. She was kinda blurry to look at. I think she's a hallucination, a product of the drugs.\n\nOh, now the walls are bleeding, they are absolutely perspiring with blood. Definitely a bad trip. At least I know that this is all fake, just a product of the drugs I took mixed with the stress in my life. \n\nGod damn! Scared the hell out of me. I went to get up from the desk to get some water and that fuzzy girl's head was between my legs looking up at me. I jumped and hurt my knee on the desk. Luckily she disappeared when I looked back down. Damn illusions, damn drugs.\n\nI think I'm in more trouble than I initially thought. When I got up to get that cup of water I felt a pain in my ankle. Sure enough there's a bruise the whole way around it. Did I twist it when I jumped? Or maybe that girl was real. No, that is so stupid. I can't believe I'm even writing about the fact the some creepy girl would be real.\n\nThere's been a banging coming from the bathroom for several minutes now. I'd be beyond dumb to check that out now. My drugged out mind would conjure something crazy that would probably scar me for life or something. Nah, I'm just going to stay right here at this desk. What do you know, the banging stopped. Guess I got the fear out of my head.\n\nThe little girl is sitting on the bed. She called out my name and brought up some memories. She's not as fuzzy as she was before, I actually recognize her now, dumb subconscious. The past should stay in the past. Really starting to think these drugs were a bad idea.\n\nShe won't stop talking about the past. There's something behind her on the bed now too. I can't really see it but I'm afraid and I don't think it's the drugs now. I'm really really scared. \n\nTried to leave. Something hit me in the head hard. Vision blurring. Head spinning. Blade, sharp.\n\n*Howe's entry ends here.*\n\nClearly Howe was guilty about something. I'm guessing that if we went back to whatever town he lives in and checked the records that we'd come across a missing persons case for a young girl or maybe he just injured a girl at some point in his life to effect him like this.\n\nAs for drugs he never actually took any, the body was thoroughly inspected and no drugs were found in his system. The punks he bought from most likely gave him sugar or some kind of placebo and Howe thought all those strange things happening were not actually real.\n\nHowe went missing sometime during the night and he was not seen again until his corpse resurfaced. \n\n*Day Two - Andrew Seaburg*\n\nSeaburg was a public official in the area. A lot of people around here already know how full of shit he is, always putting his slant on things, taking bribes, that kind of stuff.\n\nAnyway, he ended up at the motel on day two of the Room 184 occurrences. For someone of his position to be there I bet he was meeting up for a shady deal. He's played off bad business practices before and I'd believe he'd get paid to do it again.\n\nWorkers at the motel mentioned that Seaburg was gone for most of the day before coming back to the hotel around 6. We lucked out in that he was being followed by some junior reporter looking for a scoop. He had been tailing Seaburg for a few days and was peeping on him and saw what happened in Room 184. The reporter got spooked by what he saw and disappeared after that night. He came to us a couple days after the bodies started showing up. Apparently Seaburg's corpse ended up in his apartment complex and that was more than enough to convince him to come to me.\n\n*The reporter's account of day two.*\n\nI'd been following Seaburg on and off for several months before that day. I had gotten a tip that Seaburg was prepping for a big deal of some kind and I wanted to be the one to get that story. Actual and irrefutable proof that Seaburg was dirty would pretty much make my career. \n\nHe planned this meeting for months before it actually taking place. People had to be paid off, location to meet had to be chosen, bullshit exchanged from both sides, the whole deal. \n\nI followed Seaburg to the motel and the meeting that followed. As I had expected he met with some overseas criminals looking to get deeper roots put down in Detroit, I noticed both Russians and Chinese there though. Kinda weird as I didn't think the criminal elements in those countries worked together. I couldn't get near close enough to hear anything though, I was set up several buildings away. Anyway, money was exchanged and Seaburg wasn't killed so I believe that means the negotiation was successful.\n\nHe went around town a bit to hit up a fancy restaurant and go to a rather expensive looking lounge before heading back to the motel. While there some black suited guys came to see him, all very secret like. Not sure what the meeting was about but maybe he was double crossing the Russians and Chinese. Maybe he was double dealing whatever it was that everyone wanted from him. I'm not sure, I still couldn't get close to him.\n\nAfter the suits left I took the opportunity to move a bit closer. It was starting to get late and I guess Seaburg had something in the suitcase that demanded his attention so to my surprise he stayed in the motel room. He ended up working at the desk for awhile and that's when I started to notice the weird things going on in the room.\n\nIt was all just small stuff that I didn't put together at first like shadows in the corners of the room, flickering lights, mysterious whispering. Enough to put someone on edge without making them believe that something supernatural was going on. I can tell you that Seaburg never noticed any of it, just kept on working on papers from the briefcase he had.\n\nThe first instance that night where I knew something was wrong was when I looked over towards the bathroom door. There was a shadowy figure in there and it just...well, it had that quality that instantly made me believe it was real and not a figment of my imagination. It wasn't looking in my direction however, it had its head turned toward Seaburg. It disappeared a few minutes later and I stayed to see what would happen next, started taking pictures too although none of them ever properly developed.\n\nEvery several minutes after that I'd catch the shadow figure get closer to Seaburg bit by bit. I assumed by now that the thing was either going to hurt him or scare him and I was ok with it either way. Seaburg was an utter dirtbag and he'd deserve it. Plus, the shadow had never made any acknowledgment that I was even there so I felt even more safe. That lasted until it did notice me.\n\nI was pretty much pressed up against the window awaiting whatever was going to happen to Seaburg when the shadow figure suddenly appeared pressed up against the window with a noticeable expression of anger. It was looking right at me and I bolted. When I looked back towards the window the figure was right behind Seaburg. I went straight home after that and didn't see Seaburg or the shadow figure again. Well, I didn't see Seaburg again till his corpse popped up around me. I'm afraid maybe that shadow thing is targeting me now or something and I at least want to share what I know. If there's no trial to be had I plan on leaving town, no way I want to be near this city or the motel ever again.\n\n*End of the account.*\n\nI would've liked to talk to him some more but he disappeared the next day. His apartment was still full of his items so I'm not sure if he was taken or if he skipped town without taking anything.\n\n*Day Three - The Greene Family*\n\nThe Greene family was comprised of William and Mary Greene as well as their two kids, Matthew and Terry. They were from out of town and passing through Detroit to meet William's brother for a vacation down south. William had stopped in Detroit to surprise a friend but they were out of town and The Greenes ended up staying at the motel and getting Room 184. We found that much out by talking to family members.\n\nMary Greene had bought a video camera to record their vacation together and it was later found with her corpse. The night's events had been recorded although we had to send it to a technician to have the footage cleaned up first.\n\n*A description of the recording of Mary Greene's video camera.*\n\nThe camera turns on to show the Greene boys laughing and playing in the back seat. The camera turns around to show William Greene with a frustrated expression on his face. The camera turns once again to show that Mary Greene is the camera hold and she tuts several times before turning off the camera.\n\nThe next shot from the camera shows the Greenes pulling in to the motel and William going in to the main office. Mary talks to Matthew and Terry explaining the situation. The boys are unfazed and William soon returns with a key to their motel room, Room 184.\n\nThe next several clips from the camera are of the family getting to the motel room, unpacking what little items they needed from their luggage and then deciding to go out for dinner. Mary forgets to turn the camera off and sets it down  on the desk.\n\nOver ten minutes pass before the entity, a hazy and slender figure, that had been standing in the corner opens its eyes, allowing you to see it for the first time. After you've seen the entity and rewind the footage to go back you then realize that the entity had been standing there the entire time. (Researchers have looked through the footage and experimented with it to a degree. It appears that the entity can become invisible to the naked eye until it chooses to be seen. On camera this can be seen with the entity not appearing to the viewer the first time until it allows itself to be seen. Research is ongoing.)\n\nThe entity begins to shamble towards the camera when it suddenly turns its attention off screen. The camera distorts here and the footage of the next thirty seconds or so is lost to static and bursts of color and noise. When the camera refocuses a more shadowy and stout figure is seen staring in to the bathroom. The camera flicks between static and clarity several times before becoming fully static. It stays this way for about five more minutes, only becoming clear again as the Greenes walk through the motel door. Mary notices the camera is still on and turns it off.\n\nThe camera turns on to show the family playing a board game on the motel floor. Mary is holding the camera while Terry gets up to do a stunt dictated by the rules of the game. As she raises the camera a young girl is seen standing in the back of the bathroom with a face covered in wounds. Mary gasps and drops the camera but when she picks it back up and the family investigates no girl is found. Mary chalks it to stress or sleepiness and the family decides to rest for the night. Mary has the family wave to the camera before turning it off.\n\nA green blur as the camera turns on and makes attempts to focus while using the limited night vision feature of the camera. It slowly focuses to show that all members of the Greene family are asleep. William and Mary are sleeping in the bed while Matthew sleeps in a cot and Terry sleeps in a makeshift bed made on the floor. Nothing happens immediately and several minutes pass with little activity. Terry's body starts to jerk slightly and then a hand or appendage of some sort can be seen around his foot, slowly dragging him under the bed. Once Terry is knee deep under the bed the pulling becomes more smooth and constant until he disappears beneath the sheets.\n\nSeveral more minutes pass and then Terry steps out from the bathroom. His movements are quick and jerky and he moves over to the cot that Matthew is sleeping in. Terry places his hand on Matthew's head and the camera begins to distort. The distortion ends and Terry looks up to the camera for a moment. He then grabs both sides of the cot and folds it up, bending Matthew's body in a way that should've caused him to scream out in pain. He remained silent and Terry drags the cot back in to the bathroom. The camera flickers several times and turns off.\n\nThe camera flickers on once more to the hazy figure standing beside the bathroom door. It appears to be looking over at the bed but the lack of defining features makes it hard to tell. The figure slips in to the bathroom and several minutes go by before Terry's voice screams from the bathroom. William jumps up and runs to the bathroom while Mary runs over and grabs the camera in an effort to use it as a weapon.\n\nA wave of distortion passes over the camera and William is thrown from the bathroom in to the bedroom wall. Mary screams and runs to the door but stops just short of the door. The camera is raised and we see a seizing Terry covered in wounds on every bit of his unclothed skin. Mary takes a step back, turns around, and comes face to face with the hazy figure from before. The static and distortion takes over the camera and it stops recording there.\n\n*End of all footage on the camera.*\n\nMary Greene was later found a couple neighborhoods over outside of a diner. The corpse was a little dirty but there were no wounds on the body. She was still clutching the camera as well. Initially all the footage on the camera after they arrived at the motel was distorted, but I sent it to a couple of guys I know that are tech wizards and they salvaged this much. The bodies of Terry, Matthew, and William have yet to be found.\n\n*Day Four - Bryan Cook and Cynthia Fletcher*\n\nBryan Cook and Cynthia Fletcher are the two people who checked in to Room 184 on the fourth day. Bryan was found with his head impaled on an antenna several streets over and Cynthia was found in a factory with her stomach blown out and all her limbs cut clean off and stacked beside the torso.\n\nWe called up some friends and family and found that Bryan had driven up to Detroit to meet Cynthia who lived here. The two were romantically involved and did not want to spend the night with Cynthia's roommate so they went to a motel to be together in private.\n\nThe owner of the hotel had seen Cynthia when she walked in and had his peep cams put on that night to catch footage of her. Luckily we stumbled upon the cameras when we were searching the room and we were able to force the owner to hand over footage for the nights he had the cameras on over the ten days.\n\n*A description of what the peep cams recorded.*\n\nThe first several hours recorded are solely of the intimate time Bryan and Cynthia spent together. Both the bathroom and bedroom cams had to be fast forwarded for awhile before anything could be picked up. \n\nThe bathroom cam picked up a small flickering figure at some point during the couple's love making in the bedroom. The figure appears to look in to the camera and slowly materializes as the girl from the previous night with cuts across her face. The camera has a brief burst of static and then the girl is replaced by Terry Greene in almost the same position. He has wounds on his visible skin and blood on his pajamas. The camera records this switching of the girl and Terry four more times over the next half an hour before the camera goes to full static for several hours. \n\nLater Bryan gets up and leaves to go pick up dinner for them. Cynthia walks in to the bathroom(which is when the bathroom peep cam turns back on) and begins to look at herself in the mirror. She frowns for a second and goes back to the bedroom to retrieve a pillow. She stuffs the pillow under her shirt and fiddles with it until she looks like she is pregnant. She then begins to examine herself and the look it has on her. Cynthia lets out a long sigh and turns to leave the bathroom when the door slams shut on her, trapping her inside. She bangs on the door and screams but no one comes to her aid. The bathroom camera flickers and goes black. The bedroom camera shows the shadow standing on the other side of the door, staring in to it intently.\n\nSeveral hours pass and Bryan comes back to the motel. (Bryan had been detained as he was at the scene of a hit and run and was asked to stay for questioning.) He walks over to the door and knocks on it and gets no answer. Bryan shrugs to himself and lays down on the bed. The shadow is seen moving towards the bed as static overtakes the camera.\n\nThe camera in the bathroom comes back to life. Cynthia is in the bathtub with her arms and legs held out. The flickering entity of Terry/the girl stands in the corner staring at her. Cynthia appears to scream but no noise is picked up by the camera nor does Bryan hear her. Terry/the girl walks over to the tub and appears to stretch and elongate itself. The camera flickers and then the elongated Terry/girl forces itself down Cynthia's throat. The force that was holding Cynthia's arms and legs releases her and she stand up coughing. Her stomach swells up to a size that makes her look heavily pregnant and she appears to be in great pain. \n\nThe static in the bedroom camera disappears and Bryan's arm is seen disappearing in to the ceiling. He is not seen alive again. In the bathroom Cynthia grabs her stomach in pain before falling to the floor. The girl is seen ripping out of her stomach amidst bursts of static and video distortion. The shadow is seen entering the bathroom and the video distortion obscures all footage after this. The camera returns to normal the next morning showing the maid cleaning the apartment and all the possessions of the couple and blood/gore gone.\n\n*End of video description.*\n\nBetween these last two videos I knew that something a bit beyond me was going on. With the first two days I would normally chalk stuff like that up to drugs or illusions, but I saw the footage. I've seen the monsters and they are scary as hell. I talked things over with my superior and he got in to contact with you.\n\n*This half of Case File 11 ends here.*\n\nI'm back NoSleep. I'd mentioned to several people that I was having issues with crap like job hunting and whatnot. Well, that all got a thousand times worse with a surprise visit from the family for my birthday, which wouldn't have been bad cept they used my house as their place to stay. Then both my cars broke down and that was pretty much horrible, more shit happened, so on and so forth. It's all mostly resolved and here we are again. \n\nOn my end nothing supernatural has happened. Life has carried on as normal as it could be through stress and all that jazz. This particular Case File has been taking me forever to write but I'm putting up the first four of the ten days now. I'm going to immediately start working on the last six days and hope to upload Case File 11.2 tomorrow which will finish this up so we can continue onwards.\n\nAlso we have the [Case File Wiki](http://case-file.wikia.com/wiki/Case_File_Wiki). It's still being put together so we are welcoming help there.\n\nStay safe NoSleep, remember that I absolutely plan to follow these to the conclusion. Barring death, I will always be here to shed light on the files."

        "body": "*Case File: 011-300*\n\n*Case File Date: 10/5/1998*\n\n*Location: Detroit, Michigan*\n\n*Subject: Various People*\n\n*Entity: Room 184/The beings within.*\n\n*Day Five - Darryl Morrill*\n\nDarryl Morrill was a teen from the local neighborhood. A lot of the kids in this area have it rough and Darryl was certainly no exception, we found out he was abused and beat by his stepdad on a regular basis. This caused him to steal his family's savings and attempt to skip town. He called up an old friend who had moved out of town and arranged for him to drive up to Detroit and pick him up. It would take the friend a few days to make the drive so Darryl's plan was to wait at the motel until the friend made the journey up. \n\nDarryl's friend was actually the first person to come to the police with a missing persons report out of all the friends and families of the other victims. When I talked to him he told me that Darryl had given him a call from the motel to let him know that he had the money and for his friend to make the drive. This phone call was the only insight we have in to what happened to Darryl until his body turned up.\n\n*A transcription of the conversation between Darryl Morrill and his friend, Michael Bradwick.*\n\nMichael: Hello?\n\nDarryl: Hey man, it's Darryl. The plan is a go! Come and get my ass.\n\nM: Aw sweet dude! Where you staying?\n\nD: Remember that shitty motel on the other side of the neighborhood? The one around all the shut down factories?\n\nM: You mean the really dirty one that just has a vacancy sign cause their other sign was stolen? That place is rough, I can't believe you're staying there.\n\nD: It may be dirty but it's cheap as hell. I'll need all the cash I have to get me by till I can find a job. You still running and dealing?\n\nM: Nah man, I got out of that when I met Kate. I still have a few old contacts though, could call in a favor or something to see if I could get you in. Can't say I entirely approve though Darryl, plenty of cash out there doing safe work.\n\nD: I think I'll just stick to my guns, do what I'm good at. Ya know?\n\nM: *Audible sigh* I know, I just think you can do better.\n\n(Long pause)\n\nM: You still there man?\n\nD: Yeah. Sorry, must've zoned out or something.\n\nM: It's cool, just a bit worried about you.\n\nD: Hey, I'll call you back in an hour or so ok? \n\nM: Alright man, I'll be here.\n\n*Three hours pass.*\n\nM: Darryl that you? Took your time calling, I had a few things I wanted to do today.\n\n(Silence)\n\nM: Darryl? You there man?\n\n(Unintelligible whispering can be heard.)\n\nD: Save. Me.\n\n(Phone call disconnects.)\n\n*Michael immediately left his house to make the trip up to Detroit. He stopped at a diner on his way to eat and was called to the pay phone by the waitress.*\n\nM: Uh, hello?\n\nD: Too late Michael. Too...(The phone lets out a static scream and disconnects.)\n\nM: Darryl?! Come on buddy say something! \n\n*End of the phone call transcriptions.*\n\nAccording to Michael he drove straight up to Detroit after that but by then Darryl was gone and the Day Six victim was already staying in the motel. Michael came to the police the next day but little was done immediately as it was believed to be a simple runaway case. Darryl's body was found later near his house. No visible wounds were found.\n\n*Day Six - Kenzie Adams*\n\nKenzie Adams was one of those save the animals, save the planet, save anything that isn't manmade hippie types. There was some eco convention in town, a seminar on how to clean up Detroit and other big cities. This girl made the trip to attend it and I'm sure fighting for trees doesn't pay well so she ended up in the motel, Room 184 again. The owner once again noticed that it was a young female guest and he had his peep cameras on to watch her.\n\n*A description of the peep camera's footage.*\n\nThe day time footage shows that Kenzie was away from the motel all day. (Records show that she attended the first day of the convention.) The peep cameras in both rooms did not pick up any supernatural footage at all during that time. She returned to the hotel late at night and proceeded to take a shower. The exact moment she steps in to the shower the bedroom camera begins to distort slightly. This distortion continues until the shower is complete and Kenzie exits the shower. \n\nKenzie looks into the mirror and her expression turns to one of pure horror. (The camera is positioned in a way that does not allow one to see the mirror so there is no indication of what she saw.) She runs from the bathroom and attempts to leave the apartment but the door doesn't open.\n\nThe static and distortion on the cameras picks up and several animalistic creatures crawls out of the bathroom. Kenzie slams on the door and screams but no one is there to answer. The animistic creatures creep closer to her as the distortion increases further. The closest one takes a swipe at her and the cameras shut off.\n\n*The footage ends there.*\n\nKenzie Adams' body was under a bridge in another part of town showing signs of being fed upon by animals. Before I saw this footage I would've chalked it up a killer dumping the body and stray dogs eating it but, well, now I know. This is scary shit that we're dealing with and I hope you can help me.\n\n*Day Seven - The Ricochet Boys*\n\nThe Ricochet Boys were a local punk rock band, doing a little homework I've found that it was a four person band: Brad Harraway, Colin Haft, Nate Munoz, and Remi Acker. Turns out their shows tended to get out of hand and all of them except for Remi Acker had some sort of record. The band had a successful show at this basement venue a few streets down and decided to hold a small after party at the motel. The four members of the band, three girls that had attended the show, and a mutual friend of theirs, James Morgan, were there. Friends say that James always followed the band around with a video camera in an attempt to make a documentary out of their punk rock lifestyle and rise to fame. He recorded the events that happened in Room 184 that on the seventh night.\n\n*A description of the events caught on James Morgan's video camera.*\n\nTwo girls are sitting on the bed and begin to talk in to the camera between fits of laughter. Most of the words they say are slurred and unintelligible due to other people talking in the background but phrases such as \"...you want me to do what?\" and \"You're in the band too right?\" can be heard. James seems to give up on his advances with the girls and pans the camera around.  Colin and the third girl are both leaning against the wall talking while Nate and Brad are on the other side having a loud conversation with broad gestures and hand motions. Remi is sitting alone at the desk writing out something in between flicking his writing utensil around.\n\nJames: Hey Remi, what're you up to man? Don't ya know it's time to party?\n\nRemi: Oh. Hey James. (Remi's face immediately glares at the camera. Friends said that Remi wasn't fond of James.) If you have to know I'm working on new material. We aren't going to go anywhere as a band if we get stale. Music is all I got so you guys can party.\n\nJames: Ok man. Still, you should definitely get your drink on after the keg gets here.\n\nHalf an hour passes with nothing going on out of the ordinary. A delivery man with the keg of alcohol arrives and it's wheeled in. Everyone partakes of the beer except for Remi who stays at the desk writing. At some point James and Colin get in a brief fight after James attempt to woo the girl that Colin had been talking to but it is quickly resolved. The party continues on for a bit longer and Brad speaks up.\n\nBrad: Guys. Guys. Hey guys, gather round. James, over here. Stop trying to fuck those girls, they already know you aren't in the band. Camera over here dude. So, it's almost Halloween and I'm sure we won't all be together for it so I have a little ghost story to tell. Remi! You coming over here to listen to this?\n\n(James swings the camera over to Remi.)\n\nRemi: I can hear you just fine from over here.\n\nBrad: Well, suit yourself. You ladies ready to be scared?\n\n(The girls squeal in mock terror and James trains the camera back on the group that is now in a circle in the middle of the bedroom.)\n\nBrad: Alright, now here\u2019s the story of a man who stalked this very neighborhood to find pretty girls to murder!\n\n(The next ten minutes pass as Brad tells the story in grandiose fashion. A loud crash from the bathroom makes the girls scream and James turns the camera towards the bathroom door.)\n\nColin: What the fuck was that?\n\nBrad: Remi, was that you man?\n\nRemi: Me? I\u2019ve been sitting over here the entire time. If anything I\u2019m sure this is part of your silly story.\n\nJames: It can\u2019t be. No one has moved the entire time unless Brad had someone else sneak in to the room.\n\nColin: I guess I\u2019ll check it out if no one else will.\n\n(The camera swings back to Colin. A young girl is now standing behind him.)\n\nJames: Colin, turn ar-\n\n(Static overpowers James and the video mid-sentence. When the static fades James is now in the bathroom with two of the girls, Remi, and Brad.)\n\nBrad: What the fuck was that thing? Where's Colin?\n\nGirl One: Melissa's gone too!\n\nJames: You weren\u2019t looking? That bitch ripped him in half!\n\nRemi: What\u2019re you talking about? No way a little girl ripped Colin in half.\n\nJames: I was right across from him! I saw what she did. I imagine it got Melissa too.\n\nRemi: Or she actually got away.\n\n(A loud thump at the door cause everyone to panic and the girls to start screaming once more. The camera fades to black momentarily and when it picture comes back the shadowy being is between the girls.)\n\nJames: (Barely heard through static) Oh fuck, oh fuck! Run!\n\n(The group runs from the bathroom only to be met by the young girl again. She briefly flickers before the camera gives way to static.)\n\n*The camera\u2019s footage ends there.*\n\nPoor kids, we\u2019ve found most of their bodies throughout the area. Wounds were similar to previous victims. Kind of rough that something like this could happen to a group of people so large.\n\n*Day Eight - Cai Yu*\n\nI\u2019m afraid we have next to nothing on this Cai Yu. No record, no family, little history. Hell, we can\u2019t even dig up where he worked. Workers at the motel say he didn\u2019t talk much to anyone. We also found out that he had been staying at a different hotel or motel every night for the past several weeks. Only thing of his that we did find was this locked briefcase. It\u2019s pretty heavy duty; we sure as hell couldn\u2019t get it open. I\u2019m guessing we give it to you?\n\n*The briefcase was opened several days later. The contents were not shared with anyone outside of Organization 440.*\n\n*According to the documents recovered Cai Yu was in Detroit for negotiations. The negotiations were being held for the Chinese to establish a research facility for the paranormal within the city. Now that we have this information a strike/raid is being planned in response to this. The Chinese will not be allowed to infiltrate Detroit.*\n\n*Day Nine - Neil Francis* \n\nNeil Francis was a private investigator hired by the brother of William Greene. When the Greenes never showed up Myles Greene became more than a little worried and sent Neil to check out the last place he knew the family was at: Room 184.\n\nWhat we have on Neil about his encounter at the motel is from a recorder he kept on him at all times to record his thoughts or interviews with others.\n\n*The transcription of Neil Francis' recorder.*\n\nI've reached Detroit and found the motel. I'm surprised the Greenes would stay in a place like this. I know Myles has a chunk of money and I'd suspect his brother wasn't a slouch either when it came to funds. Still, sometimes you just can't pass up cheap.\n\nAs luck would have it I managed to snag the same room William Greene and his family did. I've begun searching the room but there's currently no evidence as to what happened to them or where they went. I also managed to get a couple of questions answered by several employees. They remember the Greenes staying here but said that they were checked out and gone the next day. Myles will be meeting me here tomorrow so I may as well ask around a bit more and give the room a much more thorough search.\n\nIt's night now, I spent most of the day grilling employees here and combing over the room. No one saw the Greenes leave, not one person saw them check out. Apparently the money and key were left on the desk next to the bed and the maid took them to the front desk. Very strange behavior. Also, I've searched the room and have discovered some low quality hidden cameras. Someone here is a creep. I'll ask around about those tomorrow when Myles is here to back me up. Hopefully they were on and recording the night the family stayed here. I believe it is time for me to get some shuteye.\n\n(Mumbling) It's two something in the morning. A loud thump or crash woke me. It's either from the bathroom or the next room over. (Thumping noise) Bathroom. Definitely the bathroom. \n\n(Clacking noise as the recorder is set down and left on. Neil's voice can be heard from a distance.) Hello? Who's in there? Terry. You're Terry aren't you? Look, your Uncle Myles sent me here kid. Jesus you look pale. Come back to the bedroom, I got some extra clothes you can put on to warm up.\n\n(More noise as Neil picks the recorder up once more. Low static is constantly playing at this point.) I found Terry in the bathroom. Kinda scared me since he was standing in the corner. Kid looks pale and a little sickly but he looks just like the kid from the photo Myles gave me. Hasn't said a word yet either, I'm guessing he's traumatized or something. Calling Myles now so he can get up here and maybe help this kid out.\n\n(The recorder is put down once more.) Myles, I found Terry. Yes he's sitting on the bed now. No I haven't found anyone else yet. I woke up to a loud noise and Terry was just in my bathroom. I have a couple of other small leads but this is definitely our best shot. He's not talking though, I think maybe he's spooked or rattled. If you could get up here soon I'd appreciate it. Seven hours? No, that's fine. You don't have to rush that fast if you don't want to. I don't mind watching over the kid at all. (Loud burst of static followed by a loud thump.) Jesus Christ! Floating, he's fucking floating! Oh God-\n\n*The recording ends there.*\n\nNeil's body has yet to be recovered. We actually found that recorder on another victim, Myles Greene.\n\n*Day Ten - Myles Greene*\n\nLike I said Myles had sent that investigator up to the motel to check things out while he made time to drive up himself. The plan was for the two of them to meet up on the tenth day and to search together for leads but that didn't work out. On Myles' body we found Neil's recorder as well as handful of notes clenched in his hand. From the looks of it Myles began his own investigation when he got there and paid the price that happened the other nights.\n\n*A transcription of Myles Greenes' notes.*\n\nCan't believe this. I rushed up here after that phone call between Neil and I cut off now both Neil and Terry are missing. Did he take him? Is he planning on getting money out of me by taking Terry? I don't know. Maybe an employee or two saw Neil leave with Terry.\n\nNone of the employees have seen Neil today. What's more they even got mad at me for asking questions. Maybe Neil pressured some of them yesterday and left them a bit sore to people inquiring too much. I have nothing better to do so I'll search the room like Neil did. Maybe I'll figure out where he or William went.\n\nI spent the whole day searching and came up with nothing. No blood, no secret things, no nothing. I'm getting frustrated and angry. I need to find them. I'll sleep on it and hopefully figure something out tomorrow.\n\nMiddle of the night, I'm locked in the bathroom, huddled in the bathtub with my pen and these notes. I'm in terrible danger and I don't think I'll last the night. This may be what happened to my brother and Neil and I have to make sure that there is some evidence left behind for the staff to find.\n\nI woke up to a loud noise just as Neil had. After I shook off my grogginess I put two and two together and rushed in to the bathroom hoping to find Terry or another member of William's family. The bathroom was empty and I returned to bed. Before I could fall asleep I heard this weird yipping noise. Kind of a mix between a dog making noise and a wet gurgle sound. I looked up to see these crawling shadow things. Very animal-like in appearance but I knew right away they weren't stray dogs or ordinary creatures.\n\nThere was three of them. They were all sitting on the far side of the room by the desk staring at me. I remember thinking how horrifying it was to see the three sets of eyes glowing. I stared at them for awhile and they stared back. I'm pretty sure the middle one even smiled at me. As soon as I moved an inch they all quickly arched up as if preparing to charge me. I stopped moving and they returned to their sitting position. I remember sitting their for maybe five minutes before I finally decided to try running again.\n\nI jumped out of my bed and sprinted towards the door. I heard the animal things yelp and run towards me. The door wouldn't open and in a panic I accidentally flipped on all the lights. I shut my eyes and curled up in a fetal position, ready for the beasts to attack me. A minute went by and I was still alive so I opened my eyes. I was in the room alone. \n\nI got up and attempted to walk back to my bed but my legs wouldn't move. It felt like something had grabbed me by the feat. I looked down to see that my shadow was not my own. It was a weird elongated figure that had itself clamped around my feet and it's hands were slowly moving up my legs. I once again looked around and the only thing within my grasp was the light switches so I once again flicked the switch and I felt the pressure around my legs and feet vanish. I guess it would make sense for a shadow to need light in order to be tangible.\n\nI checked the door again just to confirm that I was trapped in here. The door didn't budge and I knew I couldn't go back to sleep. It was at this point that I started to piece my little theory together. Those animals, that shadow, they were the reasons William and Neil disappeared. Otherworldly beings in my motel room. Weird, maybe even slightly absurd, but that was my reality.\n\nI believe an hour or so passed by before anything else happened. I spent that hour sitting at the desk trying to piece together what I had just seen. If my notes seem calm at this point it's only because I had time to accept this and to accept my fate. My thoughts were broken my another loud thump from behind me. I turned to see a hazy figure staring at me like those animals. The figure was both like and unlike the shadow. Not well defined physically except for the eyes. I could easily tell where the eyes were. \n\nA brief period of time passed where I stared into those eyes and then the hazy being became blurry to the point where I thought I could see two separate copies of it. Then a loud thump let out and the being took a step towards me, image as sharp as a razor. It was then that I grabbed the paper and my writing utensil and locked myself in the bathroom.\n\nI wish I could say I was safe in here but Terry is in the corner. That'd be great except he isn't always Terry, every once in awhile he turns in to this little girl that I think is covered in blood. Even that wouldn't be too bad except she does this thing where her face contorts and her mouth opens impossibly wide and when she thinks I'm not looking she takes a step closer. She's only a step or two away from the tub now, definitely within arms reach. Somebody please find this and lock this room up. It's dangerous to sleep in Room 184.\n\n*The note ends there.*\n\nLike I said, we already found Myles' body. Poor guy. Anyway this should be enough info to shut the motel down or go public with it or something right? People gotta know that his paranormal stuff is real. There's all the info I have from working on this case. Good luck guys.\n\n*End of Gary Nesbit's interview.*\n\n*Action Taken: Gary Nesbit is to be killed immediately. His knowledge and personal interest in this puts him above bribing. Most officials should be able to be bribed. Erase the victims from all records and eliminate any close ties they may have had. The motel is to be shut down via a condemn order. This will keep further people form getting involved and study of Room 184 can be covertly conducted.*\n\n*Analysis: Multiple entities being involved seems to suggest that Room 184 is a nexus for the paranormal. Perhaps there is a large amount of P-Particles in the area. There is also speculation that this was the work of a singular entity that had multiple forms and \"standard ghost\" abilities. Research will tell over time.*\n\n*Case File: Closed.*\n\nHey guys, it's been a week or so since the first part so I am pretty glad to finally get Case File 11 off my computer. As is usual for me I made a release date and was shat on by the world. I don't actually deal with stress well so I spent the vast majority of the last week trying to fix what happened in a rather single minded fervor. The second I knew the issue was resolved is when I started typing this out again. I suppose all eyes are now on to Case File 12. I'm excited. I now have enough reasons to never stay at a motel ever again so it's time to ruin something else I may potentially enjoy.\n\nAnother thing to note is that [Whittaker.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m7wry/hello_rnosleep_allow_me_to_introduce_myself/) I've had several brief conversations with him, basically me trying to figure what his angle was, learning a bit about him, and then trying to figure out if I believed him. I'm not sure if I do fully believe him but Tattle seems to be interested in him so that makes me interested in him. This is also the first time that I've seen a picture in the folder. It was placed right after Case File 11 so it makes sense that Tattle put it there. [The picture.](http://i.imgur.com/hRHuKXP.png)\n\nI've gone almost 24 hours without sleep so...I'm going to read a weeks worth of comments and PMs and then see if I'm sleepy or not. Stay safe NoSleep, have an awesome day for me."

        "title": "Case File Letter A: Another Auspicious Anecdote",
        "body": "*Case File: This will never come to pass.*\n\n*Case File Date: Somewhere around 2013, possibly a Tuesday.*\n\n*Location: Elsewhere.*\n\n*Subject: Everyone who will never matter.*\n\n*Entity: Everything.*\n\nSecrets is having a bad time but he\u2019s almost come around. Let me share another story to pass the time. Maybe I\u2019ll even tell you why he fell silent. It\u2019s kind of delicious if you happen to get off on tragedy.\n\n*Story Time*\n\nCollege. A place of much curiosity and the occasional lesson learned, both scholastically and otherwise. Our young protagonist enters the scene now. This man while perfectly normal on the outside was a sick, sadistic shell of the person he once was on the inside. He had developed horrific habits and done the Devil\u2019s work just to appease his nature. Or perhaps to strengthen his nature. It\u2019d really be an open debate as to why twisted people do the things that they do and I simply have no time for that in this chapter.\n\nSo, this young man was running the gambit on atrocities a human being could do. Murder, torture, and manipulation were his game by night. No one was truly safe as children, men, and women were considered prey in equal measure. A scream of variable pitch was still a scream, and young blood was still blood spilt upon the earth.\n\nThis particular week the young man had been on binge of sort, killing those who indulged themselves just a bit too much. That one girl from the party who had passed out on the couch, the guy in the bar who gets thrown out after one to many and is set to staggering about his urban surroundings, that girl from the club experiencing a whole different universe just because of a small strip of paper. He\u2019d collect them at their weakest and dispose of them in whatever fashion his brain could cook up. Sometimes a simple slash of the throat and disposal was in order. Sometimes he got creative. Breaking the bone in the legs so that they could be bent backwards and sewn into the upper back provided him with several more hours of whatever it was that killing and pain provided.\n\nHe had attended yet another party in hopes of finding his next victim. Frat party of some sort, hooligans and excessive drinking were particularly abundant. He skulked around a bit, making his rounds and appearing to be quite jovial while in truth he was just looking for someone to show a sign of weakness. The mark finally made herself known when she stumbled down the stairs and began to snort amid her laughs as two men picked her back up and refilled her cup with that amber sin. She was perfect.\n\nHe had to play his game carefully though. If too many people saw him close to her then he could become a suspect when the pretty corpse was found. So he played a game of distance and followed her for a time when the moment was right. Several cups later and she was even worse for the wear. He took the initiative and pointed out to a few that she was ready to go home. One misled soul took this as his chance to get lucky and jumped on the chance to walk her home. Of course our protagonist had assumed a person like him would be the one to lead her away from the prying eyes of others.\n\nHe followed after them further into the city and patiently waited for the right time. When it arrived he struck fast, a hard blow to the back of the man\u2019s cranium and a slam headfirst into the nearest building. The girl, in all her infinite stupor, could only giggle uncontrollably at the sight she had just saw. Then he did what he had done so many times in the past. He took the girl beneath one of the many overpasses in the city and readied his hook, tonight\u2019s weapon of choice. Our morally deficient protagonist was just about to carve this girl into a modernist masterpiece when he was tackled to the ground by an unknown figure. The hook was wrestled from his hand and he found himself pinned to the ground, head swimming with numerous excuses, each one worse than the last.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been following you for awhile _____ __________. I was hoping to get ahold of you before more people would hurt but it\u2019s been a solid year now and you\u2019ve proven hard to handle.\u201d\n\nOur protagonist went limp; he hadn\u2019t been as careful and smooth as he had previously thought. This yet to be introduced man knew his name and had claimed to be following him for at least a year. Any excuses were unneeded now.\n\n\u201cSo you found me. You know my name, what I\u2019ve been up to, and all that jazz so there\u2019s no reason for me to make excuses. If you\u2019re going to kill me or arrest me do it quick otherwise I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m going to gut you and try to hide.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t hide _____, not with that nature of yours. Well, not yours per say but I think you know what I\u2019m getting at. You\u2019ll actually have to kill again rather soon.\u201d\n\nThe protagonist\u2019s chest tightened and his heart jumped a bit. His thoughts were a muddled mix of surprise that someone could know so much about him, joy that he could possibly be fixed, and an alien rage that wanted to know if the hook could be inserted into one eye socket and curved to come out the other.\n\n\u201cWe were friends once, you and I, but I had to move far away because of something dark hidden within the house we often shared. That same dark thing is what is wrong with you and my employers would gladly fix you. All you need to do is come with me and after it\u2019s all done I do hope you\u2019ll consider their offer.\u201d\n\nAt that exact moment two best friends from long ago were reunited and the Unknown was there to see it.\n\n\u201cAlright, I accept. But make sure to keep me restrained or this hook is probably going through your head at some point tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoted.\u201d\n\nThere you have it curious reader. A continuing tale of two people you know little about. \u201cWhat about Tattle? What about Secrets? What about all the paranormal happenings that you\u2019ve refused to explain to us?\u201d you may be asking. In due time dear friends. \n\nOh yes, and that juicy Secrets gossip I promised? Matters of the heart are to blame for his absence but he\u2019s nearly pieced himself together once again. I swear, just remove loved ones from your life and you'd be so much more happy. Have a preemptive Welcome Back from good ole Tattle."

        "title": "Case File #12 Vivisection 89",
        "body": "*Case File: 089-162*\n\n*Case File Date: 03/18/1997*\n\n*Location: Undisclosed Research Facility*\n\n*Subject: Various People*\n\n*Entity: The Winged Being*\n\n*The notes of the assistant to this vivisection.*\n\nI believe I've committed a sin today. In medical college we studied a fair bit of history. What comes to mind right now are the vivisections of animals that took place in Europe during the 17th Century and the torture committed during World War II in the name of science. Even now the Jade Dragon are committing some horrible crimes against the genetic structure of humanity all in an attempt to get an edge. Do a little horror to do a lot of good. It sounds all right to many in theory but I do not know if I can condone what I have done.\n\nAs for an actual report as to what happened I will try my best to speak from my head and not my heart. The Organization has been tracking these Winged Beings for several years now. The beings are quite good at not being seen when they don't want to and we believe they have a sort of selective camouflage. With the proper tools we were able to track them more easily in an attempt to catch one and study it.\n\nThis particular Winged Being had been staying in the Chicago area, never straying too far from the city. We tracked it for several months to gauge its speed. The Winged Being could move incredibly fast and for the most part we would never have been able to catch it. Luckily it always seemed to stop at the scene of an accident, fire, robbery, etc. We decided that the best way to catch it was when it decided to stop at one of those incidents. A small fleet of vans and trucks lined with our instruments to track it were let loose on Chicago.\n\nOur first incident with The Winged Being took place downtown. Some girl took a wrong turn and ended up in an alley she should never have been in. Several men followed her in and made the attempt to take her possessions and possibly her life. The Winged Being made it to the alley and I had the fortune of being the first one on the scene. All I saw of it was a flash of white wings and it was off in a white blur. I did notice at the time that it appeared to give off a light of its own though. We talked with the girl and she told us about the mugging and how The Winged Being attacked the muggers and saved her. I remember her calling it a 'Guardian Angel'.\n\nThe next time we came across The Winged Being was at a car accident. A man was trapped in his vehicle and there was a chance the car could ignite. Bystanders told us that there was a blur and then a humanoid figure with wings pried open the vehicle and pulled the man out. It then disappeared as quickly as it had came.\n\nThis happened over and over again. We'd get to an incident and The Winged Being had already saved all those involved. I was even starting to question if we should stop it at all. I know the higher ups wanted it studied but it was doing so much good for the area. \n\nFinally we caught it. I wasn't out chasing it that day so I'd only heard rumors as to how it was caught. A couple junior researchers were throwing the word \"bait\" around though so I now have my suspicions. I went over to Artifacts and talked with Ben a bit. He\u2019s a silly fellow due to his \u201cunique condition\u201d but I know he shares my values or at least understands them. He assured me that what\u2019s done is done and I might as well learn from this. Even suspecting dirty tactics I still had my duty to attend the vivisection and see what could be learned. \n\nDr. Marlowe met me outside of the operation theatre, giddy at the prospect of learning something new. He was both an inspiring and disturbing man. I've always found his passion for knowledge to be his greatest feature. If only he wasn't so cruel in his ways to gain it.\n\nWe suited up and were sterilized as to avoid contaminating The Winged Being. I remember that when I entered the room I was both awestruck and terrified of what I saw in front of me. The Winged Being was restrained with heavy metal clamps but was not fighting against its restraints. Its wings were spread out as far as they could be and pinned down by metal stakes.\n\nThe Winged Being\u2019s appearance was very humanlike and not humanlike all the same. It had a bald human head with golden eyes but no nose, mouth or ears. The bone structure appeared to be there for them but these were missing all the same. The rest of its body was also human besides the fact that it was eight feet tall and sturdier than the normal human. \n\nThe wings reminded me of a golden hawk or eagle and were feathered appropriately. They connected to The Winged Being with bone and ligaments that connected to the shoulder blades. If you want the exact wingspan then you can read Dr. Marlowe\u2019s report but it was massive, certainly more than sufficient for it to fly.\n\nThe eyes held intelligence in them, though with what we had seen while tracking The Winged Being this was more of a given than a new discovery. The sentience and will to do something morally good was something I had already acknowledged.\n\nDr. Marlowe started the vivisection at this point with a cut across the chest but mere seconds after he made the cut some sort of steam started to raise from the wounds and within seconds it had closed up. There wasn\u2019t even a scar to show that any damage had been done. Dr. Marlowe made several more cuts along various parts of The Winged Being\u2019s body and met with the same result.\n\nI remember Dr. Marlowe\u2019s body tense up a bit and he begun to pace. This was a pretty common habit of his when he started to process the problem and information in front of him. I could hear him muttering as well and the bits that I remember catching were \u201c\u2026biblical\u2026being\u2026\u201d, \u201c\u2026cut\u2026mortal\u2026\u201d, \u201c\u2026existence of God?\u201d.  I was still trying to piece together those bits of information when Dr. Marlowe grabbed a hacksaw from the instrument table and started cutting into The Being\u2019s wings, the part of tendon and bone that connected to the back to be precise. Instead of healing like the previous cuts some sort of blood spurted out of the wounds. It seemed to be a bit more watery than our blood and the shade of it was a much lighter shade of red as well.\n\nAfter removing the wings Dr. Marlowe made another attempt to make a cut upon the Being\u2019s torso and this time it did not steam and it did not heal. Removing the wings had removed the healing factor.  The Being looked over to me almost like it was gauging my worth or morality if that makes any sense. After a few minutes of it staring at me and Dr. Marlowe making his cuts it finally closed its eyes and did not open them again. Looking back on it I still wonder why it did this, as The Winged Being remained alive for almost a whole hour after that moment.\n\nWe learned more things about The Winged Being after taking it apart. The majority of the bones were reinforced on the outside through some means I know not the details of while the inside was hollow. This gave the being a strong bone structure while reducing overall weight. It also lacked some common organs such as a stomach, kidneys, and liver while it still had a simple heart and pair of lungs. Those were rather human like although they weren\u2019t quite as efficient as a humans. \n\nAt that point it had gotten late and much of the staff had left but Dr. Marlowe wanted to carry on through the night. I bade him farewell and returned home to write this report, which was initially going to be submitted as my portion of the study. I\u2019m not going to do that now. Instead I will send a less inspired version of this report and keep this for myself. It is clear to me now that there is more going on in Organization 440 than I wanted to believe. I have lost my faith that we are still on the right path. From now on I plan to keep a journal of all cases and projects that I work on so that I may always remember how I felt fresh from the horror but I can\u2019t bring myself to leave quite yet, not if I can prevent some bad from happening. So with a heavy heart I will go to bed now, for I believe that today I killed an angel.\n\n-Vivisection 89 Assistant Argus Hastings\n\n*Employment: Terminated.*\n\nSecrets here again. Been awhile I suppose. I've moved back to my hometown once again and tons of stuff happened. None of it was spooky stuff, though sometimes I wish that my problems were more supernatural than mundane. Regardless, I've put the stuff that has happened since October behind me and am in no way looking for or needing comforting about it. Let's just get back to The Case Files and see what happens.\n\nAs for this file, I've noticed that the File number is 089. I'm thinking Tattle must have moved this file up since so many people were asking about entities that weren't strictly evil. It's nice to know the guy listens to the stuff you say. I'm not going to take up anymore space up here so see you guys in the comments. Stay safe NoSleep, the world is a dangerous enough place without the monsters."

        "body": "*Case File: 013-198*\n\n*Case File Date: 08/13/1999*\n\n*Location: Williamsburg, Florida*\n\n*Subject: Chad Godowsky*\n\n*Entity: Lady Luck/Death*\n\n*Floppy Disk taken from the apartment of Chad Godowsky.*\n\nMy family is one of those \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have bad luck we\u2019d have no luck at all\u201d families. Anytime someone in my family has had an opportunity or the beginnings of some bit of good fortune it seems like it\u2019s dashed quickly and often met with repercussions to our entire clan. \n\nTo start things off we\u2019ve always been rather poor and our many attempts to remove ourselves from poverty have always failed hard. Any businesses we start either get no revenue and must be closed or there is an accident of some type that causes too much damage to make reopening an option. Many of us lose our jobs because of bizarre accidents or misunderstandings involving our family. Once one of my uncles called us to say he had won the lottery and we heard the next day that his house had caught fire and that he and the ticket had been lost.\n\nThis misfortune spread to more than just our financial situation as well. Some of us had the misfortune of connecting with another person only to have them die giving childbirth or killed in an accident after they helped perpetuate the family line. In fact it almost seemed like fate allowed some of us to breed just to keep this whole thing going. It may seem like insane paranoia but the patterns are there and if you\u2019re living it you see it even more clearly.\n\nI\u2019ve actually felt the misfortune of our family\u2019s luck as well. I consider myself a well-educated man. I\u2019ve always had high grades and a thirst for knowledge yet there wasn\u2019t a college around that would accept me. I\u2019ve found myself working dead end jobs and living in the world\u2019s smallest apartment instead. I met a beautiful woman and watched her die in my arms. It is truly a maddening experience to live a life that is constantly testing your resolve to keep going. \u201cBut Godowskys don\u2019t give up.\u201d Another line I heard many of my family members say when our lives were particularly low.\n\nIt seems life has taken a slightly stranger twist for me however. I first noticed her two years ago on the night my fianc\u00e9e was killed. We had been walking along the side of a bridge and a car lost control. It jumped the divider and struck her, temporarily crushing her between the side of the car and the metal barrier of the bridge. Her body and my mental state were not in good condition after the car passed her over. Bones and organs had been crushed and looking back it was a miracle she was still alive after all that damage. I remember holding her gently. I was afraid to move her and she just kept telling me how much she loved me and how \u201clucky\u201d I had been to not be hit. Suddenly her words stopped and the more intact portions of her body went limp. \n\nI held her for what seemed like hours and then finally let go. Looking back on it only a minute or two must have went by because police and rescue workers weren\u2019t on the scene yet. In fact the only person I remember seeing is a girl standing on the opposite of the bridge from me. She was wearing a white sundress and had long black hair but it was her face that I\u2019ll never forget. Forgive the childish explanation but it was like one of those holographic cards or images that kids love. The ones where you move it left to right and the image changes but if you leave it at a certain angle the images both show in a translucent way. Her face was like that. I don\u2019t know if anyone else saw it but I saw both a beautiful woman\u2019s face and a skull in equal measure. It may not seem like a frightening sight but that initial sight haunts me to this day. I blamed it on shock at the time and hunched back down to cradle my lost love. I didn\u2019t look in that direction again until the police finally led me away several minutes later and while I never looked directly but I am sure I saw that dress from the corner of my eye.\n\nI saw her three months later at a party one of my close friends was having. This was the first time since the accident that I was allowing myself to be around people and I remember my anxiety surrounding the whole situation. For the most part things were going well but some guy at the party ended up exceptionally drunk and in his intoxicated state decided it was a good idea to start telling jokes about people in accidents. I imagine he had heard something about what happened to me and was trying to be edgy. I didn\u2019t take this well and we got into a fight. Unfortunately the man was quite bigger than me and it was clear I was going to get messed up. That\u2019s when my friend intervened and things took a turn for the worst. You see, he had this really nice in ground pool that was empty at the time and a punch he took for me sent him falling into it. Fate wasn\u2019t on his side and he landed on his neck wrong, I still remember his body going limp much like my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s. I looked back over to the guy to really mess him up and standing right beside him was the girl in the sundress again. She was much closer and the skull/face thing was much scarier in close proximity and so I ran home. It sure looked sketchy and police were suspicious when they showed up at my place but everything worked out at the time.\n\nMy life got worse from there as I lived in constant fear of my bad luck getting someone killed. I was also frightened of the girl. At the time I didn\u2019t know what she had to do with me but I knew I was scared of her. I buried myself in work and managed to keep out of trouble for almost a year. The next time I saw her was while I was eating at some restaurant. They had a few tables outside and I had decided to enjoy the weather that day. Cue screaming and I turned to see that a cyclist had been splattered across the pavement. The hair on my neck stood up as I frantically looked around. I had to know if the girl in the dress was there. Sure enough I saw her in the crowd. She was close to the body but her stare was directed straight at me. I remember wondering if she was the one causing the accidents and deaths. And that if she was the one doing this was it because of something I had done. It seemed dumb but she had to have kept appearing for a reason. Or I had finally snapped and truly was seeing things. I decided to not run this time though. I continued eating my meal and periodically glanced up to see her gazing in my direction. She disappeared shortly before I finished eating though. She was just gone. Never approached me, never did anything besides staring at me. It was at this point I decided that she might have been a construct from my mind that must manifest when I was at a breaking point.\n\nShe would in time shatter that theory as I\u2019ve seen her many times since then and in situations where accidents or deaths did not occur. So I am now torn between the idea that I\u2019m being haunted or if I am crazy. I don\u2019t believe other people see her but that only gives credence to both trains of thought. A new pattern was set though; I would only see her while I was out and about. She never appeared at my place of work or home. And so until about a week ago that was how my life was. I\u2019d be walking down the street, getting groceries, visiting a loved one, etc. and she would sometimes just be there. It was an existence I got used to.\n\nYet once again the pattern was broke and my nerves pushed even further. Last week I saw her walk into the fast food place I cooked at and I almost screamed. The white sundress had been torn in a few places. Her black hair seemed to be fraying at the ends a little. Her once beautiful face seemed less so. And I saw her walk in. I\u2019d never seen her do any type of moving before. I buried my desire to scream and stayed in the kitchen until my shift was over. But I\u2019ve seen her so many more times over the week and she gets progressively harder to look at each time. The sundress she wore is now torn to shreds and covered in blood. Her hair has turned to gray and is in knots. Her face has decayed and the skull transposed upon her rotting face has disturbed me to the point where I cannot eat or leave my house.\n\nI\u2019ve written down the important things I\u2019ve remembered about this woman in the dress and am saving them to a floppy. I have this dreadful feeling that something may happen to me soon. She stood outside my apartment all last night and I think she was screaming and today IS Friday the 13th. Hopefully a family member of mine finds this and can be made aware. Our bad luck has to stop someday. Maybe a little knowledge is all we need.\n\n*The message ends there.*\n\n*Chad Godowsky was found dead several days later after tenants of the apartment building started complaining of a bad smell. The cause of death is believed to be self inflicted lacerations.*\n\n*Analysis: We believe Mr. Godowsky may have actually been stalked by a visual manifestation of Luck or perhaps Death. Both figures have been visualized by many to have a skull like visage. While this seems like we\u2019re grasping at straws a bit it is also astonishing how many bad events the Godowsky family has been through. Everything we know about chance says that something good should have happened to them at some point. While we do not have enough proof or information to prove anything this is something we should look into in the future.*\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n*Tsk, tsk. Sometimes having bad luck is MUCH worse than having no luck at all. Though it is fair to say that I've had my own share of bad luck. Also, Secrets isn't here. Not that you'll find that a surprise since he has a rather annoying habit of disappearing. As luck would have it he hasn't been idle in his self-imposed exile and I'm more than willing to share what he's accomplished. Let's sit around and see how long it takes him to figure out what I'm up to. So. How's life, Nosleep? Miss me?*"

The Star is coming and when it does you and yours will be judged and bathed in the red flames. Your disbelief will be your downfall.\n\nInterrogator: You have us all wrong\u2026Adam is it? We actually do believe it\u2019s coming.\n\nR: So you\u2019re a believer? This is fantastic. Surely if you met with the elder circle these grievances between our two groups can be mended.\n\nI: Don\u2019t get me wrong, we do believe the star is coming but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to worship it.\n\nR: Ahh. You must want to study from The Star, learn from it. High blasphemy unfortunately. \n\nI: We only knew where to look because of several other members from your little cult. We-\n\nR: Little is hardly appropriate. For if you see a dwelling marked by the visage of The Star then you have gazed upon our numbers. We are a legion of faithful.\n\nI: So there\u2019s a telltale sign that someone is a member of your group?\n\nR: \u2026I have said too much and will speak no further. You can kill me if you must.\n\nI: There will be no need for that. We have more than one way to get information out of you.  I will see you tomorrow Adam. Hope you sleep well.\n\n*The Red Star member committed suicide over the course of the night by repeatedly bashing his head off the cell wall. Second stage interrogation was not able to be implemented.*\n\n(Bit of an awkward transition here between documents. I believe that this probably started with a header of some sort to denote who was writing up this portion of the file. I\u2019m not sure why it was removed. \u2013Secrets)\n\nV. Alston \u2013 Deceased\n \nN. Bartlett - Deceased\n\nA. Brookes - Active\n\nD. Forster - Active\n\nL. Hoffmann - Missing\n\nQ. Lakin - Deceased\n\nJ. Mumford \u2013 Missing\n\nS. Wilkinson \u2013 Deceased\n\nIt would seem infiltrating this cult is harder than we initially expected. They appear to be quite adept at picking out the operatives we\u2019ve implanted into their ranks. Lakin and Bartlett stopped reporting in after the first week, Wilkinson stopped after the second week, and Alston stopped within three weeks. Authorities found their corpses later. Hoffmann and Mumford have also stopped sending in reports but their bodies have yet to turn up leaving only Brookes and Forster. While all the operatives underwent training it is important to note that Brookes opted for his memories to be altered to act as a sleeper agent and Forster has his unique ability. Perhaps there is more to these cultists other than the fact that they actually worship a very real threat.\n\n*The following are the relevant parts of the operative\u2019s reports.*\n\n**V. Alston**\n\nDay Three - After making initial contact with a recruiter I have noted that our original theory as to a star based monument being present in each cult facility as true to an extent. While present on the outside of the four dwellings/facilities I\u2019ve been to the star based monument can be a sculpture, wall hanging, or even a sculpted patch of flowers.\n\nDay Five \u2013 They unexpectedly announced that they were moving me from a residential area to one of their remote compounds. Not sure if they are on to me or if this is regular practice.\n\nDay Eighteen \u2013 Communications hard to get sent out. Watchers are more numerous than initially thought. Ritual sacrifices daily practice.\n\n*This was Operative Alston\u2019s last message before his corpse turned up.*\n\n**N. Bartlett**\n\nDay One \u2013 Little luck with getting to talk to anyone, they kept me in a room with new recruits for the entire day. None of the others seemed to know much and seemed like petty Satanists. The cult may be advertising itself in ways we haven\u2019t seen to attract youths like this.\n\nDay Seven \u2013 I am now the only one left in this room. I do not know why I haven\u2019t been contacted. I fear they may be on to me, and yet they let me leave the room. To send this message perhaps? Or maybe I answered the wrong call. I had my suspicions that the youths that had been housed in this room with me weren\u2019t serious candidates. I\u2019m going to put money on them being ritual sacrifices. Regardless of what is going on it is clear they are most likely on to me, I plan to leave to night and regroup.\n\n*Operative Bartlett\u2019s corpse was found several weeks later. It would seem her hypothesis on human sacrifice was correct as her and the bodies of several youths had signs of being restrained with precise slashes to the throat and abdomen.*\n\n**Q. Lakin**\n\nDay One \u2013 I can confirm that the group\u2019s number is large. I was led to a large auditorium where there were at least a hundred or so potential recruits. We need to consider moving on these guys soon. I can also confirm that several officials from the town\u2019s government were present.\n\nDay Four \u2013 I am now a hostage. They are having me send this last message to tell you that it is futile to try and infiltrate them. Deepest apologies on my end. Please give my wife and daughter my love.\n\n*Operative Lakin was found several hundred miles away from his infiltration point in an old warehouse. The body was in several pieces and the signs of torture were present.*\n\n**S. Wilkinson**\n\nDay Two \u2013 My deepest apologies on not be able to report in on my initial day of insertion. The patrols in this compound would put some government agencies to shame. I can confirm that officials from several of the surrounding communities report here. Unsurprisingly none of them rank high on the totem pole here meaning the Watchers are just using them as puppets. I can\u2019t stress again how organized this group is. My recommendation is to use entities or gifted operatives when we do make a strike, otherwise it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath.\n\nDay Three \u2013 A woman tried to escape from the compound today. She was heavily pregnant and from what I can tell the child was to be used as a sacrifice to either appease the Red Star or to quicken it\u2019s arrival. I can\u2019t be entirely sure because a lot of the older members no longer speak in strictly English. I would say that it\u2019s just gibberish from regular cult drug abuse but after a while I could sense a bit of an alphabet. \n\nDay Four \u2013 The unborn child was forcefully aborted in their worship area. The woman lay there sobbing until her throat was slit. The lengths these people will go to are disturbing. I know I\u2019m here to gather information but I now feel fear. I am scared.\n\nDay Six \u2013 Apologies on the late report yet again. I had to go a trial of sorts along with many of the new recruits. It was basically gladiatorial combat as we were thrown in a pit and the last few standing were allowed into the cult once more. I\u2019m not sure if the other operatives had to go through this trial or not but I am glad that my combat training made this trial rather easy. I may have drawn an eye or two by how well I performed though. Picking the false identity of a schoolteacher may come back to bite me now.\n\nDay Eight \u2013 I\u2019m sensing more of a pattern with that language they keep speaking. I can now see a clear pattern of how long you\u2019ve been a Watcher with how much English has been replaced with that other language. It would seem that all members that have been with the Watcher for a month or less still speak completely in English but after that I noticed that members start losing a word ever couple sentences. Could whatever entity the Red Star is actually already have some power here despite its distance from Earth? \n\nDay Ten \u2013 Couldn\u2019t shake their eyes on me. Practically can feel them at all times now. Something is wrong with me. Might be poisoned food, might be something else. I fear this is the end for me and I know they are watching, even now. Watching me, watching it, watching us. Abort this farce and give up. We can\u2019t win. I\u2019m scared.\n\n*Operative Wilkinson turned up a short time later in a church thought long abandoned. His body was found on a dais decorated in a sun motif.*\n\n*The mission to insert members into the Watchers of the Red Star is to be put on hold. They clearly hold some power but the difficulty of gaining proper knowledge is hampering strikes on their bases.*\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n*11/01/06 \u2013 New information has been brought to light as Operative Brookes arrived at one of our smaller recon bases yesterday. The base was located over one thousand miles from his insertion point. Unbeknownst to most in our Organization Brookes had opted to not only to have his memories removed but for one of his eyes to be replaced with a functional audio and video recording device. Brookes is in bad health and has not been properly debriefed but here is a summary of the important parts of the video he recorded.*\n\n*Brookes is in a large room of sorts. It may have been an auditorium in the past but is now decorated in the religious drawings that depict the Red Star. There is a crowd of several hundred packed into the room around Brookes while members of the Watchers are on the stage dressed in a macabre and religious fashion. Some of them have on outfits that are clearly stitched together from human faces and one of them has a helmet or religious hat with many small humans arms protruding from it. The man with the hat made of arms is in the middle of reciting some dogma relating to the Red Star.*\n\nSpeaker: There are those in this world that would say WE are the crazy ones, that WE are the ones that are wrong. But I can see MY god and I can touch MY god. Can they say the same? The Red Star is approaching and while it is still far away from this rock we were cursed to live on it is getting ever closer. We have also found methods to deal with it in closer proximity thanks to it gifting its power unto us. We will use this power to enhance our gifts to the Red Star and to deal with our enemies. Fellow Watchers, you may be new to our cause but with time you will also gain abilities beyond your imagination.\n\n*The man then takes a gasp of breath as if he had been struggling the entire speech for some reason.*\n\nSpeaker: I apologize Watchers, speaking in this tongue is hard on me. Please report to your designated initiate captain for more information. Walk in the crimson glow, vlgdrasis vaan traeoth. \n\n*The footage is now from a time in the future after Brookes has been fully accepted into the Watchers. He appears to be in a class discussing the anomalies that happen to ones body as they gain the Red Star\u2019s power.*\n\nTeacher: The Red Star grants us power but in return for that power we have to accept the role that it gives us. Some of us have to accept the fact that we will be twisted in its image.\n\n*The teacher walks to a large cage in the back and removes the cloth that covers it. A large, humanoid figure can be seen within it. It looks like it was once a man but much of the skin has a rough quality to it like the man had been severely burned. Of more importance is the fact that the man had four arms but the extra arms were in awkward places. They appeared more like a mutation than they did an enhancement. Upon seeing the people in the class the man began to froth at the mouth while screaming in the Watcher\u2019s unique language. He began to push up against the metal bars and appeared to be slowly bending them. The teacher then recovered the cage and the screaming stopped. The room is quiet for a while before one of the students begins to speak.*\n\nStudent: What, what was that?\n\nTeacher: That is one of the Red Star\u2019s enforcers. We believe that the Star gauges our very being as we connect with it to gain our power. It knows our dedication and rtrlth. Ahem. It knows our dedication and limits. Those who are given\u2026less credit when it comes to higher mental faculties are turned into physical enforcers to strike back at our enemies. This man has gained the strength of many men and it is a high honor that has been bestowed upon him. \n\n*Suddenly one of the Watcher members at the front of the room goes into spasms. Garbled noises come from his mouth and it looks like not even the teacher was prepared for this event.*\n\nTeacher: My new students fear not! I require any belts that you may be wearing. \n\nMan In Pain: Drthlay verisac cruserdo- (Screaming) I wasn\u2019t supposed to tiserilac verigon quth. I don\u2019t want this!\n\n*The teacher quickly binds the man\u2019s arms and legs with the belts he has been given. The man\u2019s spasms begin to increase and he is soon bending to unnatural lengths. It is at this time that the sound of bones cracking can be heard.*\n\nTeacher: Everyone back up, he is about to embrace the Red Star!\n\n*The power in the room goes out and it is now apparent that a dim red light is coming from the teacher and other elder member\u2019s mouths and corner of their eyes. There is also a light coming from the man in spasms although his is a darker red that is flashing erratically. An unearthly scream causes interference with Brookes\u2019 camera and only static and blackness can be seen.*\n\nUnknown Voice: He\u2019s broken out!\n\nVarious Others: (Unintelligible screams)\n\n*The camera comes back into focus with the lights flickering on and off repeatedly. Brookes is on the ground with his head turned away from the front of the room. The people he can see are staring fearfully at something behind him and suddenly a limb flies towards the back of the room. It is then that Brookes comes to and quickly turns to the front of the room. The man that had been tied now shared the same charred look as the caged man. No extra limbs are on him but his muscle mass has noticeably increased. When he turns his face to the camera you can see that he now has three eyes that glow with a fiery light. None of the eyes are in normal locations on the face. Beneath the man is one of the elder members that had been near him. That man is missing his arm and screaming out in pain. The now mutated man turn to him and begins pounding his fists into the other\u2019s body. Damage to his ribcage can be seen with each strike. More interference with the camera. When video returns the room is covered in more blood. Brookes is facing the mutated man and a woman\u2019s mangled body can be seen behind him. The cage in the front of the room has also been knocked over and that mutant is struggling to break free as well. The mutant strikes Brookes and the camera goes back to static. It remains dark for a period of days before he wakes up in an infirmary.*\n\n*Another period of time is skipped once more and we come to Brookes looking through a glass window into a dark room. In the room are a few dozen people who all appear to have hoods over their heads and are tied up. A minute goes by before the back of the room suddenly cracks and falls away into a black nothingness. This nothingness is soon replaced by an impossibly large flaming sphere. The use of the word sphere is only a placeholder as the recording device was incapable of properly recording what we believe is the Red Star. The bound people closer to the back of the room begin to slide towards the sphere against their will. Suddenly a burst of static overcomes the recording device and a bizarre howling can be heard. Suddenly everyone in the room is quickly pulled into the void. The howling intensifies and the glass window starts to crack.*\n\nUnknown Person: Rthul vera qurth!\n\n*Another burst of static and then the void and howling are gone.*\n\n*Another passage of time. Brookes is seen on an altar of sorts with various men who looked like they had religious attire on around him. The men are chanting in the Watcher\u2019s tongue. There is a flash of light as the chanting reaches new heights and then everything goes a dim red. Brookes closes his eyes presumably from passing out.*\n\n*From this point on every so often the camera will give way to static and then show macabre images. They all follow a similar theme so only the first one will be explained in relative detail.*\n\n*A suburban neighborhood is shown with most of the buildings in ruin. Walking among the ruins appear to be mutants like the ones previously seen as well as something new. For lack of a clearer view they appear to be humanoid figures made of ash. Quick flashes of men and women screaming in horror appear and then what appears to be a basement is shown. A man is slumped in a corner with ash pouring out of a chest wound. Eventually the man stops breathing and the pile of ash takes the form of an ash person and slowly shambles out of the room. More flashes of violence, fires, and death. Brookes is now on a hill that overlooks a charred forest with everything bathed in a red light. He slowly looks up and beside our own yellow sun is a much larger crimson sun.*\n\n*Life appears to go on in relative normality for Brookes after the event at the altar. He became quite a high ranking official and was overseeing his own community while periodically having those doomsday visions. The appearance of Operative Mumford seems to be what drove Brookes to leave the community and return to us. Mumford was brought in as a prisoner and was to be a sacrifice for the Red Star. Brookes performs the ritual as usual and slowly slices through Mumford's stomach. Mumford is allowed to bleed onto a circle of sigils before Brookes then slashes his throat. This last look at Mumford may have caused him to remember the Organization because his vision becomes erratic and you can hear his breathing intensify. Several members of the Watchers notice his behavior and ask of his health but he dismisses them and retires for the night. He would then go on to sneak out of the compound and seek out the recon base that we found him at.*\n\n*11/03/06 - Brookes is now dead. He experienced the same symptoms of becoming a mutant and was killed to maintain safety in the compound. There is reason to believe that the Watchers now know of that facility's location and important documents and equipment are to be moved immediately.*\n\n*Case File: Unresolved.*\n\n*05/26/08 - New information has been revealed as Operative Forster has returned. His debriefing will be listed as a separate report due to length.*\n\n*Case File: Reopened.*\n_______________________________________________________________\n\n*Fanaticism with results, what glorious synergy. Although I imagine those consumed by the fires of an angry god aren't quite as happy as those given more reign over their power. As you've seen this is yet another doomsday scenario this world is in line for. Dime a dozen.*"

        "title": "Case File #15 The 2K Virus",
        "body": "*Case File: 014-277*\n\n*Case File Date: 01/19/2007*\n\n*Location: Benton Ridge, Connecticut*\n\n*Subject: Willy McFadden*\n\n*Entity: 2K Virus*\n\n*The following is from the interrogation of Willy McFadden.*\n\nInterrogator: Mr. McFadden, we brought you here for this interview due to your encounter with a \u201ccomputer ghost\u201d. The police did not take you too seriously but I feel you\u2019ll come to see that we view this in a different light.\n\nWilly: Abduction does seem to imply you guys are at least somewhat serious. Suits help as well. So you looking for my recollection of the events then?\n\nI: That would be ideal. If you could just tell us everything you think is relevant and in the most chronological fashion way you can I would be quite happy.\n\nWilly: Happy enough to not kill me?\n\nI: Death isn\u2019t an inevitability here Mr. McFadden.\n\nWilly: Eh, I can practically see the gun concealed by that suit of yours but sure, story time. So I worked with these two other guys right? Keith and Evan. We just sorta ran this little computer techie shop. Helped old people navigate through the easy stuff and sometimes someone actually had us do some real work. It was honestly a pretty sweet deal.\n\nI: I see. Please go on.\n\nWilly: Well, ya see this whole thing started when Evan bought this computer. He was always buying them off of anyone he could for parts. I remember that he was buying some pretty solid hardware off of some Y2K nut. The guy had thrown a ton of money into his safe house and shit was bad for him the same it was for the rest of those nuts. Anyway, Evan was going on about how this computer he had snagged from the guy. Some sort of custom OS. Thing wasn\u2019t running Windows, that\u2019s for sure. People write up Operating Systems from time to time and it\u2019s cool to look into them but Evan was going on about how this was some weird future stuff. Same with the quality of the physical hardware. Now, keep in mind that this computer was supposedly put together at some point before the new millennium. It should be running Windows 98 or some shit in some off-white colored casing that had collected its fair share of dust.\n\nI: Did Evan ever figure out where the man got the computer?\n\nWilly: Can\u2019t say I remember him mentioning anything about that. I also tried looking up the guy when the weird stuff started going down. I had no luck finding him. \n\nI: What was the first moment you had a feeling that something was off?\n\nWilly: Evan started coming in looking ragged. He was the prissy and punctual one, you know? Always at the shop early, tucked in shirt, neatly combed hair. That stopped though. Pretty much the reverse happened. He was coming in an hour or two late and looked like hell. I remember Keith and I were trying to figure out what was wrong with him. I was betting on a lady friend and Keith thought he may have has some addiction he wasn\u2019t telling us about. But, Keith and I never confronted him about it. That wasn\u2019t how the three of us worked. If Evan wanted help then he would ask for it. That\u2019s what we figured at least. Maybe we weren\u2019t that good of friends\u2026\n\nI: How long did this go on for?\n\nWilly: About two weeks. He got progressively worse but we let him be. I mean, yeah. We weren\u2019t being good friends at all. Keith eventually took him out to the bar and talk things out with him. Apparently Evan was just obsessed over that Y2K gear he had snagged. And mentioned something about \u201cstopping it\u201d. Keith told me that Evan was really drunk before he started opening up so Keith assumed he was just out of it and the stress of messing with that tech was finally getting to him.\n\nI: What was the next significant thing to happen?\n\nWilly: I\u2019d have to say that a few emails I\u2019d gotten from Evan would be the next strange occurrence. I wondered why he wasn\u2019t texting or calling me but assumed he misplaced his phone.\n\n*The following messages are from that night.*\n\nEvan: Hello Will, are you up? If so I am in need of your assistance.\n\nWilly: Hey man, of course I\u2019m up. Everything OK with you? Ya know you have Keith and I a bit nervous these days.\n\nEvan: I need your help. Can you come over in an hour or so?\n\nWilly: Sure man, no problem. I\u2019ll clean up a bit and then be over. Are you alright? You have me a little worried.\n\n*The emails stop there.*\n\nWilly: He was acting weird and wanted me to come over to his place. I really didn\u2019t want to because it was just starting to get late but hey, maybe I\u2019m not quite as shitty of a friend as I thought. Or maybe I didn\u2019t want to be that shitty.\n\nI: So you went to his place after that?\n\nWilly: Yeah. I ended up going. He had wanted me to wait for an hour or so and that\u2019s what I ended up doing. Halfheartedly watched a rerun to kill time. I can\u2019t even recall what it was now. So I drove over to his place. Normally I would\u2019ve walked over but it had snowed pretty heavily the night before and I wasn\u2019t about to freeze my ass off before the imagined emotional confrontation I was about to go through.\n\nI: I imagine that is not what you found.\n\nWilly: You\u2019d be right. Instead I found myself parked in his driveway with Evan\u2019s front door wide open and all lights in the house off save for what looked like a television. Keith\u2019s car was already parked there as well. I was a little put off by the whole scene. It really didn\u2019t feel right to me, especially since Keith was already here. So I called both of them. No answer of course. I wasn\u2019t going to back out at this point so I went in and things were a little unsettling. Not blood and guts unsettling. It was more just like the state of the house. Evan kept things tidy for the most part and his house was just a mess, like he couldn\u2019t be bothered to clean up. I\u2019d almost say that it looked like someone had the robbed the place but there was a certain\u2026quality of the mess that made it look less chaotic than that. I\u2019m not sure if that makes sense. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that items looked liked they were just dropped wherever Evan had been standing when he found he had no more use for them as opposed to a fight where people were getting thrown around. After my initial shock at the state of his place I noticed that his laptop was sitting at the far side of his living room and that a large chunk of the floor space had been cleared. Now, I\u2019m not a detective or anything like that but when the rest of the floor is covered except that and that he had the webcam hooked up I put two and two together. He had been recording something.\n\nI: Did you check out the laptop?\n\nWilly: Not right away, I didn\u2019t. I called out to Evan and Keith. Not in a creeped out horror movie way, mind you. Just casual. I guess at that point I was trying to force myself into thinking the situation could somehow still be normal. Maybe I just couldn\u2019t process how weird and surreal everything seemed. No one answered me back though. I stood there quietly trying to make out sounds and was just about to head upstairs when the laptop starting playing back a video of what it had been recording. Not knowing what else to do I walked over and watched it.\n\n*The following is a description of the video contained on the laptop.*\n\n*Evan is shown in what looks to be a basement workshop with computer parts and gear lining the shelves and walls.*\n\nEvan: I have made a discovery today. I made another transaction with the man I met a few months ago for spare parts. He told me he kept these all these parts due to his prediction and preparation of the Y2K event. He was obviously hurting for money and was still pawning off his stock. Yesterday I contacted him again to ask if he had more parts. He told me that he was out of parts themselves but he still had a plethora of computers I could cannibalize for parts. Of course I took him up on his offer and he gave me six old towers and a sealed storage container that I didn\u2019t open until I returned home. In that box was the most interesting case for a computer I have ever seen. It was black and sleek with curves instead of hard edges. I was eager to plug it in and see what was on it although I suspected it was just a fancy case for an old computer. I was most certainly wro-\n\n*The video turns to static for several seconds much like when someone records to a tape although this should not happen on the medium this footage was recorded on. When the video does continue it is most likely of a later day in a den or study. Evan looks more disheveled and tired.*\n\nEvan: I think there\u2019s something in the computer. I know that sounds crazy, I really do. Not like an AI or anything but there\u2019s a guiding presence at the very least. As I go about trying to figure out that OS I keep running into dead ends. I\u2019ll take a break from trying to decipher the system and when I come back everything is just sorted out for me. The issue is that the wall I was trying to overcome isn\u2019t cleared and instead an entirely new path opens that wasn\u2019t there. Once again I\u2019m going to sound paranoid but it sounds like I\u2019m being lead to a certain location within the system. I really hope this is some kind of helpful subroutine that is guiding me to a master system or override.\n\n*Static cuts in once more. If one looks closely they will see a two persistent circles in the static that leads one to believe there is an image behind the static. It only remains for a brief time before cutting to Evan, who looks like he was suffering from extreme sleep deprivation. He is in the den once more.*\n\nEvan: I knew it! I knew there was a guiding force! After all these mind games and the touch and go navigation I found it. A rather large chunk of data was locked and hidden away by this security program. It was actually most of the data within the computer to be honest. Anyways, with that same \u201chit a wall and then come back to a solution\u201d method I was able to find it. Or him, if we want to get technical. A program calling itself Abel had been guiding me to unlock its higher functions. Abel is an AI. I can\u2019t believe it. I have so many questions.\n\n*Static cut in. This time there are three layers of static. The two circles now have a dark blob of static that surround them and behind the blob is the normal static one usually sees on a television set. The static lasts for a longer period of time at fifteen seconds before cutting to Evan who is looking even more ragged. He is in the living room with all the lights turned off and himself illuminated by the laptop\u2019s screen.*\n\nEvan: I\u2019m done with this. I can\u2019t believe it. (Long pause) I\u2019ve called Keith and Willy like I was told. I\u2019m giving up.\n\n*Evan stares at the screen for a total of twenty minutes before Keith opens the door. Evan looks at him for several seconds before breaking into a full sprint and tacking Keith to the ground. A brief scuffle is shown as the two struggle and move out of sight onto the porch. Minutes pass before Evan with Keith hoisted over his shoulder staggers into view again. They disappear down the entryway into the basement. Several more minutes pass with nothing happening until Willy walks into the house.*\n\n*The footage cuts to static for the final time and the image is finally revealed to be a humanoid silhouette with the two circles being eyes. Five seconds pass before what would be the mouth of the silhouette forms as a large third circle below the eyes and with it a metallic scream. This continues for approximately ten seconds and then the video is finished.*\n\nWilly: I didn\u2019t see all of the footage right away though. I was at the part where Evan was talking about getting help cracking the OS when a thump from the basement spooked me pretty bad. I went to investigate and didn\u2019t particularly like what I came across. \n\nI: What was it that you saw?\n\nWilly: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the police reports but it was the corpses of both Keith and Evan. My only two friends and partners were dead. Keith looked like he had his head smashed in and sure enough there was a broken and bloodied monitor lying beside him. Evan looked to have strangled himself with some cords. He had a paper clenched in one hand. To be honest I wish I could say that I was devastated right then and there but I took it in stride. Probably took it too well to be honest. I remember scanning the room real quick before deciding that Evan must have had a breakdown and killed Keith before killing himself. I grabbed the paper from his hand and was going to read it but the distant sound of sirens stopped me. I imagine one of Evan\u2019s neighbors must have seen or heard that struggle on the porch that I had yet to know about. \n\nI: If memory serves you weren\u2019t at the scene when the police arrived that night.\n\nWilly: No, I wasn\u2019t. The whole thing looked complicated and I decided that I just didn\u2019t want to be there. Maybe I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly but I panicked and ran upstairs. I was going to make a beeline towards the door but a glance at the laptop stopped me. It was playing a clip of when I had entered the house a few minutes prior. I had no idea it had even recorded all that. In my slightly rash state I snagged the laptop and bolted out the door. \n\nI: The police came eventually right?\n\nWilly: Of course they did. It didn\u2019t take them long to figure out Evan and Keith owned the shop with me. They came over early in the morning and of course I feigned ignorance. Once again I\u2019m a little shocked looking back at how little difficulty I had lying about this.\n\nI: What\u2019s the next relevant part of this tale?\n\nWilly: Well, I had forgotten about that note I had snagged from Evan\u2019s hand. I had hidden it and the laptop in this hidey-hole I had under the stairs. It wasn\u2019t until a few hours after the police left that I remembered the note and opened it.\n\nI: What did the note say?\n\nWilly: In an almost comical way I found that it was a series of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s. Evan\u2019s final note was in binary.\n\n*The note in question read 0100100100100111011011010010000001110011011011110111001001110010011110010010\n1110000011010000101001010011011101000110111101110000001000000100001101100001\n0110100101101110001011100010000001000100011011110110111000100111011101000010\n00000111010001110010011101010111001101110100001000000100000101100010011001010\n110110000101110.*\n\nWilly: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Stop Cain. Don\u2019t trust Abel.\u201d\n\nI: What did you think after reading that?\n\nWilly: Not much at that moment. It was cryptic suicide bullshit with a biblical twist. I had honestly thought Evan really did just go off the deep end. The next week was filled with the police occasionally meeting with me to ask a few questions and cleaning out our office as I had lost the motivation to keep the business going. This is when I was contacted by Abel.\n\nI: Abel contacted you? How so?\n\nWilly: I started getting cryptic texts from Evan\u2019s phone that were all signed by Abel.\n\nI: What did they say?\n\nWilly: At first it was nothing intelligent, mostly weird combinations of letters and symbols. Eventually I started getting the words \u201ctechnology\u201d and \u201csavior\u201d written in binary. Phrases like \u201cstart over\u201d and \u201cinfect the masses\u201d as well. I must have received that same text a few hundred times.\n\nI: You had to know not to trust Abel. What was your next move?\n\nWilly: Of course I did. I had read the note. I mean, I still wasn\u2019t convinced but the timing was a little too perfect for me to ignore. That led to me keeping the laptop locked up. I had seen Abel\u2019s name come up a few times and at this point I still hadn\u2019t opened it since running from Evan\u2019s. I was planning to keep it that way. Unfortunately, simple texts were just the beginning. Abel started sending death threats to me. They were simply short binary texts such as \u201cdeath\u201d or \u201ctime is short\u201d. I ignored them the best I could and kept myself busy by looking for a new job. Then I would walk into the living room or bedroom only to find that the TV in that room would be on with a screen of static playing. This started to persist even after I unplugged the TV. I also started getting phone calls from unknown numbers with static on the line. If I listened close enough I could sort of make out a voice but it was so distorted that you could blame your imagination on it. Even my computer would freeze and the error screens would have threatening lines in the error message. It actually got to be crazy with just how much hostility I felt from this Abel.\n\nI: And you couldn\u2019t go to the police due to lying about your previous whereabouts. \n\nWilly: Exactly. I was so dumb. Though I doubt they would\u2019ve believed me anyway. In fact, they didn\u2019t believe me so\u2026\n\nI: So, what next? You had suffered some aggression from Abel but it was mostly verbal with nothing coming of it.\n\nWilly: I attempted to ignore it for the most part. I guess I might have thought that this could go away if I just moved on. So I told no one about it and just let the texts and tech issues continue. They forced my hand eventually though.\n\nI: How so?\n\nWilly: This is where things get weird again. The police didn\u2019t like this part at all so let\u2019s see what you think of it.\n\nI: Try me.\n\nWilly: While I was job hunting and ignoring Abel I also happened to start noticing a few other things that I wasn\u2019t attributing to Abel. Dumb stuff like my shoes or keys not being where I left them or my clothes ending up just strewn about. I attributed it to my stressful situation. I just wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. Once again showing how much of an ignorant jackass I can be. Me pretending that everything was alright was just plain dumb.\n\nI: So what was really going on?\n\nWilly: I was sleepwalking. Sort of. I didn\u2019t figure it out right away but I was leaving my house, getting in my car, driving off, and doing crap. Then I guess I\u2019d come home shed my clothing and stuff and then return to my bed.\n\nI: Do you know what you were doing while you were sleepwalking?\n\nWilly: I wasn\u2019t really sleepwalking mind you. We\u2019ll get to what it was. But, for the most part I\u2019m in the dark as to what I was doing. I ended up getting that computer that Evan had bought though. The future tech one? Yeah, it was just sitting in the backseat of my car one day. At that point I had already figured out I was sleepwalking.\n\nI: What if I told you that we had some footage of something you did while \u201csleepwalking\u201d?\n\nWilly: (Looks uncomfortable) While I don\u2019t know exactly what I did I do have my suspicions. Is it as bad as I think it is?\n\nI: Unfortunately. Take a look.\n\n*A television that was kept off to the side of the interrogation table turns on. A description of the footage that was played follows.*\n\n*Willy is seen in a compound full of storage units. It is dark out and the camera operator is peering at him from the side of another storage unit. Willy\u2019s movements have a hint of unnaturalness to them. He moves much like a slumped puppet that the puppeteer is struggling to move. The camera operator slowly follows him through the compound until he finally stops at a storage unit. The camera person is forced hide for a moment as Willy slowly turns to their direction. When they peer around the corner Willy is once again looking at the storage unit, although now the lock is off and the door is wide open. He shambles into the unit and the camera person slowly approaches the storage unit. They press up against the wall and edge up to the side of the door. Peering inside they find nothing. The sound of shuffling gravel is heard as the camera operator spins around. They let out a gasp as Willy appears inches away from them in mid-lunge. The camera person is throttled over the course of the next minute before Willy releases them and they fall to the ground. In a stroke of luck the camera is aimed towards the open storage unit. Willy slowly enters the unit and does not return.*\n\nWilly: (Somber) I heard that cry. Who was she?\n\nI: She was the second agent I sent after you.\n\nWily: There were more?\n\nI: One before her. He did not have a camera on him but he had been tailing you like her. We recovered both of them before anyone could stumble upon the bodies and cleaned up the scene. No one was the wiser.\n\nWilly: Why? Why do that? I could have been caught. That could have stopped this.\n\nI: You have to now realize that we know exactly what you were dealing with Mr. McFadden. We didn\u2019t take any unnecessary risks with you. Please continue your tale. I hope you now see that I will take everything you have to say as a serious matter.\n\nWilly: (Deeply sighs) Alright, so as you can see for yourself I wasn\u2019t being very\u2026me while I was \u201csleepwalking\u201d. Although I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what I was doing I woke up with blood on me a few times. Wasn\u2019t my own. I eventually came to the conclusion that something must have been guiding me in my sleep. It just didn\u2019t add up to normal sleepwalking. Plus, I had no history with sleepwalking before my encounter with Evan and Abel. When I had suspected I was being controlled I decided to find a way to stop it. I figured the laptop and that computer were the key to it. Equal parts my way out and my damnation, if that makes any sense. Abel clearly wanted me to mess around with the damn things, which meant they had something to gain. I wasn\u2019t about to give them that.\n\nI: You had your suspicions on what Abel truly was by this point?\n\nWilly: Yeah. Well, in a way. I finally retrieved the laptop and watched the rest of Evan\u2019s log. I saw the face in the static. The spookiness, lack of a physical being, and my loss of control over my body led to things adding up. Very Science Fiction. It wasn\u2019t you guys was it?\n\nI: No, not exactly. We will get to that in time though. Please continue.\n\nWilly: I plugged in that computer and started fiddling around. Evan had unlocked much of the computer\u2019s true functions just like he had mentioned in his log. That computer was not like anything I\u2019d ever seen. Without Evan working it out ahead of time I doubt I\u2019d have been able to navigate it at all. Unlike Evan, I looked at all the code and programs from another angle. Patterns emerged, more pieces falling into place. A section marked Id, Ego, and Super-Ego. I could not make heads or tales of the actually programming but I knew those functions quite well. After a while I found a final lock. There was one last section that was locked off.\n\nI: Did you unlock it?\n\nWilly: No. I don\u2019t think I could have opened it on my own to begin with. I didn\u2019t know how. In fact, I got it in my head to just destroy the damn thing and tried.\n\nI: What happened? \n\nWilly: Passed out mid-swing. I woke up two days later, covered in blood not my own. The computer was gone. I panicked and contacted the police. I told them my story and they locked me up in a cell at the station to figure out the things I had told them. Then you guys came in and took me. So I think I need answers now.\n\nI: Ok. Abel and Cain are two functions of the same AI. From what we know Abel never had much of its functions locked off. Its purpose was to act as a proxy in the real world to unlock Cain.\n\nWilly: That makes sense from what I\u2019ve seen. Abel tried scaring me into doing it initially but that didn\u2019t work due to my own ignorance. How did it control me through my sleep?\n\nI: Normally Abel would not be able to possess you but it appears that it tapped into some of Cain\u2019s sections after Evan unlocked them.\n\nWilly: I was possessed by some sort of computer ghost after all then\u2026 Who programmed it?\n\nI: In a way, no one. The AI that Abel and Cain compose is an unholy fusion of human and machine. The supernatural are very much real Mr. McFadden and someone decided to bond it to a machine. The reason you could not understand a large deal of the programming in that computer is because it was the code of God or nature itself. A being created through 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s among other things.\n\nWilly: Several months ago I would not have believed you. Why would someone do this?\n\nI: It was for an attack on the United States. It was to happen January First, in the year two thousand. This AI was the real Y2K threat that everyone should have feared. We stopped it then and confiscated the hardware. At some point it was smuggled out of one of our warehouses and made its way into your friends hands. We\u2019ve been trying to reclaim it ever since and thanks to you we have.\n\nWilly: Thanks to me?\n\nI: The final lock on Cain\u2019s programming, the very functions that would fully awaken the AI and allow it to begin infecting the population, was a combination of science and the supernatural. Apparently, enough blood has to be spilled to release the programming. This was put in place by someone who works for my organization after we recovered the AI. Although I cannot fathom why a blood sacrifice was chosen. You resisted the AI attempting to reprogram you long enough for us to stop you and recover the computer, though you did attack and injure some of our agents. I had decided to leave you to your own devices but you turned yourself into the police. I now offer you a way out. Work for us and stop things like this from happening again.\n\nWilly: A job offer then?\n\nI: Better than you will get from the local authorities I assure you.\n\nWilly: When ya say it that way I guess I hardly have a choice. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t shoot me after all. I can atone for some of this I hope.\n\nI: We will see if you always feel that way.\n\n*The interrogation ends.*\n\n*Action Taken: Mr. McFadden is to be hired as a researcher. His quick thinking coupled with a passable knowledge of technology makes him more useful to us alive. Unbeknownst to Mr. McFadden he still contains traces of Abel\u2019s programming in his very being. The applications of this can be studied while he sleeps and at some point we hope he can be made a willing subject.*\n\n*Analysis: The 2K Virus has always been somewhat of an enigma to our staff. Its very existence was made clear to the public, although in a misleading fashion back in the years preceding 2000. It appears that someone's consciousness was bonded to technology creating a \"computer ghost\". This entity has considerable power such as the ability to possess others. If the 2K Virus had broken loose it would have infected a large amount of technology to fuel itself before moving on to the population. We believe it would be in control of the entire Earth's population in a matter of several years.*\n\n*We are not even entirely sure who was behind the \u201cBlack Box\u201d as we now call it. It was found in the possession of a terror group that had planned to use it on the United States. However, it was clear after the raid on their base that they did not create the AI. One of the Zones may be the cause of this, although this is simply speculation now. There\u2019s also disappearance of the Black Box holding the 2K Virus from one of our facilities. It is not currently known who removed it or who the man that sold it to Evan is. Inquiries will be made but at least the Black Box and its contents will be safe once more.*\n\n*Case File: Closed.*\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n*I will do a little searching of my own. I stumbled upon some documentation of the process used to create this AI several years back. Simply a matter of remembering where I placed it. Too many secrets to sort through I'm afraid. Perhaps I could send it to Secrets if he ever returns.*"

Her back is turned away from the camera as the cameraman slowly creeps up behind her.*\n\nDaniel: Boo! (As he says this he grabs her side with his free hand.)\n\n*The woman gives a yelp before turning around and laughing. The two embrace and the camera is cast to the side of the bed. The couple are no longer in the camera\u2019s view but the sounds of kissing can be heard.*\n\nLisa: We\u2019re going to have a wonderful trip, right?\n\nDaniel: Of course Lisa! You, me, Tom, and Cindy. We\u2019re going to have a blast and we get this chance all because of you.\n\nLisa: I didn\u2019t do anything Dan.\n\nDaniel: You had the good fortune to have found long lost family that are willing to pay for you and some loved ones to see them. You get to actually meet someone you share blood with and we all get to have a great time romping around Finland. For free!\n\nLisa: It\u2019s still a little strange that they\u2019d be so willing to see me though. I mean, I never met mom or dad so I guess besides you I don\u2019t really know family but\u2026\n\nDaniel: Look, it\u2019s a chance to learn a bit more about yourself. Or at least where you came from. Changes nothing about you. (Laughter) And I\u2019ll be here to love you every step of the way.\n\nLisa: Oh my prince!\n\n*The two seem to get up and return to packing with the camera forgotten. Eventually Daniel sees it and turns it off.*\n\n*The next shot from the camera is from the inside of a vehicle. Daniel is driving, Lisa is in the passenger\u2019s side of the vehicle operating the camera, Tom and Cindy appear to be sitting in the back seat.*\n\nDaniel: Come on you two, getting into a fight like this right before our trip isn\u2019t cool. \n\nCindy: It\u2019s fine Daniel. We won\u2019t let it ruin Lisa\u2019s vacation. Right Thomas?\n\nTom: (Grumbling) Yeah, sure.\n\n*Daniel gives a wry look up to the mirror.*\n\nDaniel: Remind me why we brought these two again?\n\n*Lisa swings the camera over towards the passenger\u2019s side window. Various highway signs can be scene placing the four in Florida.*\n\nLisa: Probably because we don\u2019t have any other friends.\n\nDaniel: Oh. Yeah.\n\n*The two burst out laughing as Cindy is heard sighing loudly.*\n\nTom: So, do you guys want to clue us in on where we\u2019re going? Finland is a little vague. You called us three days ago and begged us to go on this trip out of the blue.\n\nDaniel: As you know some long lost relatives of Lisa have sought her out for god knows why and invited her to their small manor in Finland. The town is called Ruovesi I think. It\u2019s a small town on the edge of some lake or park or something.\n\nLisa: Helvetinj\u00e4rvi I think it was called.\n\nTom: Hella what?\n\nLisa: When we looked it up it translated to Hell\u2019s Lake or something.\n\nDaniel: Spooooky. (Laughs)\n\nLisa: Oh come on, we\u2019ve seen the pictures of the place. It\u2019s beautiful. The name is just that, a name. Anyway, I believe we\u2019re going to stay a few days with my family before setting out on a camping trip. That was the agreed upon plan, right?\n\nCindy: Yes, we\u2019ve packed what we can get on the plane. Thomas and I can buy the rest of what we need when we get there.\n\n*Tom mutters something that the camera does not pick up clearly.*\n\nCindy: (Talking in a hushed voice but the camera picks up some of it.) \u2026just a meeting Thomas\u2026I had to turn down an\u2026hibition for this\u2026\n\n*Lisa pans the camera over to Daniel for a moment. He is glaring at the rear view mirror. She then places the camera on the dashboard, forgetting to turn it off. Lisa possesses a distant look and appears to lose herself in thought.*\n\n*The group drives in silence for several minutes before Daniel slams on the brakes, bouncing the camera off the windshield and then towards Lisa.*\n\nDaniel: Son of a bitch! Use a turn signal, asshole! (Sighs) Sorry about that guys.\n\n*Everyone mumbles something before Lisa notices that the camera is still on. She looks at it for a moment before turning it off.*\n\n*The next clip from the camera is from inside an airplane.*\n\nLisa: Dan, you can\u2019t have that on! Seriously. That stewardess is going to kick your ass.\n\nDaniel: Nah. We\u2019ll be fine. I just wanted to get a look at the ocean.\n\n*Daniel places the camera in front of the window and the ocean can be seen below. Several seconds later the stewardess comes over and asks him to turn off the camera.*\n\n*The next clip shows Daniel holding the camera up with it pointed towards himself. They appear to be in an airport.*\n\nDaniel: Well, we made it! Plane shook a few times and that stewardess never really warmed up to me but I am alive.\n\n*Lisa steps into frame and latches onto Daniel\u2019s arm.*\n\nLisa: That\u2019s because you were being bad.\n\nDaniel: Only a little.\n\n*The couple laughs and continues walking through the airport. Behind them Cindy and Tom can be seen both walking with a sour expression on their faces.*\n\nDaniel: (Whispering) Looks like someone didn\u2019t enjoy the flight.\n\nLisa: You\u2019re telling me. Bunch of sourpusses. \n\nDaniel: Let\u2019s do our best not to let them ruin our day.\n\n*The next scene on the camera shows that the group is now in a taxi van. Daniel is holding the camera on his lap and occasionally raises it to get a glimpse of the outlying area.*\n\nTom: How much do you know about your family Lisa? These guys are related to your mother right?\n\nLisa: Yeah, they told me that my mother moved over here a year or so before I was born. Apparently it wasn\u2019t on the best of terms. My mother died giving birth and I never knew who my father was. I guess authorities never found out that I had family overseas and I grew up in the orphanage with Dan.\n\nTom: That\u2019s right. I\u2019m sorry, I forgot that you and Daniel lived in an orphanage before you met Cindy and I. That was college right?\n\nLisa: Yeah, the four of us shared what was it\u2026statistics? And hey, it\u2019s no big deal right? I ended up with Dan and I don\u2019t regret my childhood. Plus, I guess it is sort of a bonus to be able to meet some blood relatives of mine. I wonder how they even managed to track me down.\n\nTom: Maybe they hired a private investigator or something. I\u2019m guessing your mom left enough of a trail for them to follow to you.\n\nCindy: Seems like an awful lot of trouble just to meet one relative.\n\nLisa: That\u2019s what I had thought as well but apparently they are quite big on lineage and family heritage and all that stuff. I think they\u2019re looking to see who inherits the land and manor. For whatever reason they chose to meet me and include me as family. I guess I should be grateful for that. \n\nDaniel: I just think we should enjoy the free vacation. It\u2019s not everyday that someone offers to pay for an entire trip to Europe.\n\nTom: (Sighs) Ever the free spirit this one.\n\nDaniel: You say that like it\u2019s a bad thing.\n\nTom: Look; people don\u2019t do nice things unless they have something to gain. Why would these people even go through the trouble of finding Lisa? They could have split up whatever wealth there is between them and Lisa would have been none the wiser.\n\nDaniel: Some people are actually nice. That\u2019s just something you\u2019ll have to come to terms with. Besides, I\u2019m pretty sure Lisa doesn\u2019t appreciate you ragging on her family like this. \n\nTom: Alright, alright. I\u2019ll drop it for now. \n\nDaniel: Exactly! You can judge them after you meet them. It\u2019s more polite that way.\n\n*The audio cuts out on the camera as Daniel lifts it to view a stretch of forest. The audio does not return until the next time the camera is turned on. Daniel is once again holding the camera and is now filming the four of them walking up to the manor. It is a large property with a small and winding road that leads to the manor proper. The audio of the camera becomes distorted the moment that Daniel points his camera in the direction of a large forest in the distance. When the forest leaves frame the audio returns to normal. This happens four times on their walk up to the building. When they reach the door they are greeted by Lisa\u2019s family at the door.*\n\nLisa: Hello, I\u2019m Lisa. It\u2019s so good to finally meet you.\n\n*Three people step out onto the porch: an older woman, a younger man, and a younger woman. The man and woman appear to be young adults around the age of Lisa and her friends. The man appears to be staring in the direction of Daniel and the camera while the younger woman is gloomily staring towards the porch floor.*\n\nOlder Woman: Thank you for coming to our ancestral home on such short notice. I fear my time on this planet grows short and it is time to properly divide our families belongings amongst the younger generation. I feel it would be wrong to exclude my beloved Annika\u2019s own daughter, my granddaughter. I am Veera and it is amazing to see you at last. You look so much like your mother.\n\n*The man behind Veera clears his throat.*\n\nVeera: Oh yes, these are your cousins Oskar and Tiia. They are the children of your mother\u2019s sister. Iina is no longer with us.\n\nLisa: I\u2019m pleased to meet both of you. I\u2019ve lived without knowing my family for a long time so it is beyond wonderful to know I have some kin around my age. \n\nTom: Hello there, I am Lisa\u2019s friend, Thomas. I don\u2019t mean to be rude but how did you know to look for Lisa? It seems odd that you\u2019d suddenly find her and contact her out of the blue.\n\n*Veera turns to face Tom and her body holds a strange tense movement to it before she returns to her original posture.*\n\nVeera: Come inside child. We\u2019ll talk about this in the comfort of our home.\n\n*The three Finns return inside with Lisa, Tom, and Cindy following. Daniel holds back for a moment and turns the camera towards his face.*\n\nDaniel: Those three were cre-ee-py. Good thing Lis didn\u2019t grow up with them. I\u2019d hate to see her look like such a grump.\n\n*As he turns the camera around to turn it off there\u2019s a frame that was caught after the retrieval of the camera. It is a blurry shot as Daniel is in the process of turning the camera around but to the left of Daniel, approximately fifteen meters away is a tree line that leads into a patch of forest. Within the specified frame there appears to be a tall, almost gnarled looking being of a brown hue. It would almost appear to be a humanoid looking shape. Daniel assuredly does not see this as the next time the camera is turned on the group is sitting at a table in a rather ornate dining area.*\n\nVeera: You asked how I found Lisa? If I am to be honest then I will tell you that I dreamt of her. Over the last several months I have had a reoccurring dream of my darling Annika. She looked so sad. Eventually I saw a second woman in my dream as well and it was Lisa. I knew that something was guiding me towards her and I began to inquire after your mother\u2019s whereabouts. I was saddened to learn that she has passed on but elated to find she had a daughter. I knew immediately that you had to be brought here to learn of your heritage. Your mother and I may have parted on bad terms but I will make it up to you.\n\nLisa: Thank you Veera. That means so much. I don\u2019t mean to be rude but is there a lot of legal formality that we\u2019ll have to go through with the inheritance? My friends and I were hoping to check out the nature in the nearby forest. \n\nVeera: Fear not child, I recalled that you asked about Helvetinj\u00e4rvi and your intention to see the lake. I purposely planned for the matters of inheritance to be scheduled after you\u2019ve had some time to enjoy the area a bit. In fact, Oskar has prepared something for you. Go on, boy.\n\n*Oskar retrieves a folded up map from his suit pocket.*\n\nOskar: I have spent a large portion of my life working with the caretakers of the forest. Our family actually contributes to a portion of the park\u2019s funding and we work closely with the Mets\u00e4hallitus to protect the land. I have guaranteed that a rather large portion of land on the far side of the lake will be practically devoid of tourists. It would be a perfect time to camp there.\n\nLisa: Thank you so much Oskar. This gesture really means a lot to my friends and I!\n\nCindy: I don\u2019t want to play the rude foreigner but is your granddaughter all right Miss Veera? She has said nothing since we\u2019ve arrived.\n\nOskar: Please excuse my sister. Our mother has passed rather\u2026recently and she is still reeling from the loss. I do hope that you\u2019ll respect her wishes to be left alone.\n\nCindy: Oh my. Oh no. I\u2019m so sorry. I meant no offense of course.\n\nVeera: Do not worry about it. Now come, it is almost time for supper. Oskar will show you where you\u2019ll be staying for the night.\n\n*Daniel retrieves the camera and fumbles to turn it off. The next time the camera turns on it shows Daniel and Lisa sitting in a bedroom. Daniel is sitting on the side of the bed fiddling with the camera and Lisa appears to be reading a novel of some type.*\n\nDaniel: So\u2026what do you think of your family?\n\nLisa: They\u2019re alright, I guess? We really haven\u2019t had much time to get to know them. Veera seems like a kind enough woman, if a bit high class. Oskar and Tiia just went through some recent tragedy so I imagine we won\u2019t really see what they\u2019re like right now. The grieving process is important.\n\nDaniel: Yeah. I can see what you mean.\n\n*Daniel fiddles around with the camera for a few moments before Lisa looks over to him.*\n\nLisa: You seem a bit off, Dan.\n\nDaniel: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s me that\u2019s off. I feel like this place is a what\u2019s off, if that even makes sense. I don\u2019t want to sound like Tom or anything but I\u2019m starting to get a vibe. You know me and my vibes.\n\nLisa: (Loud sigh) I know Dan. I know they weren\u2019t the most normal of people but you have to remember that we don\u2019t even share many of the same customs. Some things are bound to be offensive or weird to us. Maybe just take a second to breath and regroup and then after the whole camping trip you can give the family a second chance?\n\nDaniel: You\u2019re right. (Laughter) I\u2019m being such a lame ass right now and I\u2019m sorry. I bet it is just a little cultural difference that has me uneasy.\n\nLisa: Don\u2019t sweat it sweetheart. Now let\u2019s get some sleep so we\u2019re ready for the trip tomorrow.\n\n*Daniel turns the camera away from him for the last time that night and powers it down. The next time the footage resumes the group is now backpacking through the forest.*\n\nCindy: How much further is it to the campsite or where ever it is we\u2019re going?\n\nLisa: Not much further. Just another ten or fifteen minutes in that direction I think. We\u2019ll know for sure when we hit the lake.\n\n*The footage remains normal for a few minutes as the group treks further into the woods but suddenly becomes choppy and distorted. Daniel is holding the camera at his side and through the static and distortion a humanoid figure can be seen stalking the group. The distorted footage and figure disappear as the group finally reaches their destination.*\n\nDaniel: Pretty sure this is the place. There\u2019s a fire pit over there. \n\nTom: I\u2019d have to agree. Cindy and Lisa, help me set up the tent. Would you take a quick look around Daniel? \n\nDaniel: Not a bad idea. I\u2019ll see if I can find anything that may have been leftover by the previous group. Maybe some firewood. Be back soon guys.\n\n*Daniel takes several minutes to inspect the area surrounding their campsite. He eventually comes to a crude wooden idol. Daniel inspects it for a minute before returning to the campsite.*\n\nDaniel: And I half expected the tent to still be lying on the ground.\n\nTom: These instructions were rather easy to follow.\n\nLisa: Find anything babe?\n\nDaniel: There\u2019s tons of sticks and stuff on the ground. We can gather up the stuff that\u2019s dry enough to burn. I did find this strange wood carving though. It kind of looks like a monster or something. \n\nLisa: Hmm\u2026maybe it has something to do with the name of the region? Could be a deity.\n\nCindy: Oh yes, I\u2019d forgotten all about that.\n\nTom: Don\u2019t worry about it Cindy. Local superstition and lore will not hurt you.\n\nCindy: I\u2019m not scared Thomas. Just\u2026unnerved I guess. \n\nTom: Well don\u2019t be. At least not about immature stuff like that. I\u2019d be more concerned about the wildlife.\n\nLisa: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s helping Tom.\n\n*Daniel sets the camera down as the group rather quietly finishes setting up camp. The next shot from the camera is of the group sitting around a fire. Daniel and Lisa are cuddling up while Cindy and Tom have several feet between them.*\n\nCindy: I don\u2019t see how you two do it.\n\nLisa: Do what?\n\nCindy: Be all cutesy and happy all the time. Don\u2019t you get tired of it?\n\nDaniel: We\u2019ve been together for practically forever. If Lisa can survive how much I teased her when we were kids I\u2019m pretty sure she can survive anything.\n\nLisa: (Laughing) And the same goes for Dan making it through how emotional I was as a teen. I\u2019m pretty sure he thought I was going to stab him some days. \n\nDaniel: Only a few times. (Laughs)\n\nLisa: (Still laughing) You dick!\n\nTom: Being that close to someone. That must be nice. \n\nDaniel: Like she said Tom, we\u2019ve been together since we were kids.\n\nCindy: Well I\u2019m going to bed. It\u2019s getting cold out here and I\u2019m exhausted.\n\nDaniel: But it\u2019s still rather early.\n\nCindy: I haven\u2019t been sleeping well since we arrived. I think it\u2019s the jetlag.\n\n*The group bids her goodnight and sit around the fire for another hour or so before Lisa also goes to sleep.*\n\nTom: I\u2019m jealous of the relationship you have Daniel. I don\u2019t mean Lisa herself, of course, but that closeness. \n\nDaniel: Trouble on the home front? You can tell me man.\n\nTom: Cindy and I rarely talk these days. You know that us getting together was under troubled circumstances to begin with and everything just soured even more so with time. I want to leave but I feel I\u2019ve invested and given up to much to start this relationship in the first place. I\u2019d loathe wasting those sacrifices.\n\nDaniel: That is truly and odd way of looking at things. If you aren\u2019t happy then you aren\u2019t happy. That\u2019s how I feel about it anyway. Maybe you should take some time to think about how you feel about Cindy and your life situation. If things aren\u2019t panning out then you leave. Find that happiness. \n\nTom: I\u2019ll think about it. Thanks Dan.\n\n*Daniel picks the camera up and turns it off while muttering something about wasting the battery. The next frame shows Daniel\u2019s face as he scrambles to get out of the tent. He\u2019s fumbling with a flashlight.*\n\nDaniel: Lisa? Lisa?!\n\n*Tom can be heard from inside the tent.*\n\nTom: Dan, what are you doing?\n\nDaniel: Lisa\u2019s gone! \n\nTom: What? Shit. Cindy, wake up.\n\nCindy: (Mumbling) What?\n\nDaniel: LISA!?\n\nCindy: Why is he yelling? \n\nTom: Lisa appears to be missing. We\u2019re going to help Daniel find her.\n\nCindy: No. I\u2019m just going to sleep.\n\nTom: Are you serious?\n\nCindy: Yesss. I\u2019m tired. It\u2019s late.\n\nTom: You heartless bitch.\n\nDaniel: Guys, this isn\u2019t the time for that shit. Let\u2019s just go find her Tom. Now. Cindy can stay here or whatever.\n\n*Daniel spins the camera around to look back into the tent. Tom can be seen visibly glaring at Cindy who appears to be falling back to sleep.*\n\nTom: Fine. Let\u2019s go.\n\nDaniel: Lisa are you there?!\n\n*Daniel walks over to the edge of the campsite and continues calling for Lisa until Tom gets dressed and joins him.*\n\nTom: What\u2019s the plan Daniel?\n\nDaniel: I don\u2019t know. I have no idea where she could be.\n\nTom: And we know she isn\u2019t just going to the bathroom?\n\nDaniel: I don\u2019t think so. The tent was left open. Her shoes and coat are still in the tent. Plus I waited for several minutes after I noticed she was gone until I started calling for her. Oh! And the roll of toilet paper is still sitting over by the tent.\n\nTom: Alright. I guess that\u2019s enough to assume something is wrong. Wait. Is that her?\n\n*Daniel spins the camera towards the direction that Tom is pointing in. A low static sound can be heard as the camera refocuses. Eventually a dark blur that looks like a person can be seen shambling just outside the cameras view. Tom flashes a light on it to reveal that it is Lisa. She moves behind a tree and the two chase after her. When they arrive at the tree that Lisa disappeared behind Daniel frantically turns his camera from side to side to find her while calling out her name. After several sweeps he stops on her slumped figure in front of the wooden idol he has seen earlier. The two run towards her with the static now making the camera become obfuscated at times.*\n\nDaniel: Lisa? Come on babe, let\u2019s get back to the tent. What\u2019s wrong?\n\nTom: Wait! Something\u2019s wrong! Don\u2019t go near her.\n\n*Lisa slowly turns around while the static noticeably lessens. Her eyes appear completely white. It looks like they may have rolled to the back of her head. Her movements as she turns are jerky and convulsive. Suddenly both she and the distortion stop.*\n\nLisa: Paholainen ottaa minut.\n\n*Suddenly a static noise overloads the microphone on the camera and the sound cuts out completely. It appears to be audible to outside of technology as Tom and Daniel cover their ears in pain. A gnarled arm with a wooden appearance is seen in front of Lisa\u2019s torso and she snaps backwards and disappears into the idol. The audio returns at this point as well.*\n\nDaniel: LISA?!\n\nTom: What the hell was that?! That was an arm right? Right?!\n\nDaniel: I don\u2019t know Tom! I. Don\u2019t. Know.\n\nTom: Let\u2019s look at this logically. Um\u2026\n\nDaniel: There\u2019s no logic man! A fucking tree branch just pulled her into this thing! What the hell kind of logic are you looking at?\n\nTom: Local lore and legends. This place is called Hell Lake. Both you and I saw what happened to Lisa so I can say with a certain amount of confidence that it wasn\u2019t a hallucination. This must be something supernatural in nature.\n\nDaniel: So a ghost stole Lisa?!\n\nTom: Probably not. I\u2019ve been reading a book on Finnish mythology lately so as to not hear Cindy complain. I think this is something else.\n\nDaniel: Whatever man.\n\n*Daniel approaches the idol and touches it in places.*\n\nTom: What are you doing?\n\nDaniel: I don\u2019t know. Looking for wherever Lisa went. Maybe there\u2019s\u2026a portal or something? God, this is nuts.\n\n*A new voice is heard although it is hard to place where it is coming from as it agitates the camera\u2019s audio. It seems to be composed of a deep bass voice, a low whispering voice, and what appears to be Lisa\u2019s voice.*\n\nVoice: There are no gods here.\n\nDaniel: Who is it?! Did you take Lisa?!\n\nVoice: I took what was rightfully mine.\n\nTom: You\u2019re a demon then? I read about you.\n\nVoice: I am Piru.\n\nDaniel: (Spinning the camera around looking for the source of the voice) What\u2019s it talking about Tom?\n\nTom: It\u2019s apparently some type of demon that stalks this region of Europe. From what little I know they play games with people. I think there\u2019s usually something to be gained from both parties.\n\nDaniel: So someone played a game with this thing and offered up Lisa? Who would do that?\n\nTom: A blood relative would work.\n\nPiru: (Appears to be coming from right behind Daniel) Indeed it does.\n\n*Daniel spins around but nothing is there.*\n\nDaniel: I-I don\u2019t know what to say.\n\nTom: Well, I do. Demon, I wish to challenge you.\n\nPiru: What are your terms?\n\nTom: I made a mistake several years ago. If I win could you take me back to fix it?\n\nPiru: I could. What do you offer?\n\nTom: I offer the life of Cindy, the woman still sleeping in the tent back at our campsite.\n\nDaniel: What the fuck Tom?! What\u2019re you doing?\n\nTom: Don\u2019t get in the way Daniel. This is something I need to do.\n\nPiru: I\u2026accept.\n\n*A blast of static and distortion flare up on the camera and disappear as suddenly as they appeared. The Piru is now standing in front of the idol and appears to be the humanoid that Daniel\u2019s camera has been picking up while in the area. Now that it is much closer one can see that it has a wooden quality to it. It is an exceptionally tall being, perhaps eight or nine feet tall. The arms appear to be long gnarled branches. The face is devoid of features except for two sockets and a collection of branches at the top of the head that twist up, mimicking the appearance of horns.*\n\nPiru: Would a riddle suffice for your challenge?\n\nTom: I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\n*The Piru leans closer to Tom.*\n\nPiru: A natural state, I'm sought by all. Go without me, and you shall fall. You do me when you spend, and use me when you eat to no end. What am I?\nTom: A natural state\u2026sought by\u2026shall fall\u2026eat to no end\u2026what am I? Is the answer money? Or currency? No\u2026\n\nPiru: Is that your answer?\n\nTom: My answer is wealth. Is wealth correct.\n\nPiru: Wealth is not correct. The answer was Balance. The woman is forfeit.\n\nDaniel: Oh no. Come on Tom!\n\n*The two sprint back to the campsite with the sound of the Piru\u2019s laughter following them. Daniel rips open the tents flap to reveal it to be empty. A small splatter of blood can be seen on the inside of the tent.*\n\nDaniel: She\u2019s gone Tom. Cindy\u2019s gone!\n\nTom: So she is. Everything worked out then. At least for me. We need to see about getting Lisa back though.\n\nDaniel: Wait. What?\n\nTom: Cindy and I were a mistake Daniel. You know this. I stopped pursuing my second degree and turned down many lucrative job offers when she became pregnant. And it was all for nothing! A miscarriage! We\u2019ve grown nothing but bitter towards each other and wasted our time. If I had won I would\u2019ve been able to stop us from getting together in the first place and both our lives would have been better. Losing isn\u2019t terrible though. You said yourself that I should leave her if I truly wasn\u2019t happy.\n\nDaniel: Tom, I\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t fucking mean you offer her up to a demon. Are you insane?\n\nTom: No Daniel, I\u2019m free.\n\nDaniel: I can\u2019t let you get away with this. You killed her.\n\nTom: Really? I was going to help you find Lisa. We were going to start over again.\n\nDaniel: I will never be able to forget this Tom.\n\nTom: In that case you are now a liability. I\u2019m sorry Daniel.\n\n*Tom lunges at Daniel, which knocks the camera from his hand. The sounds of their struggle can be heard off camera until they eventually roll into frame. Daniel punches Tom in the gut several times before he is kicked off. Tom grabs a large branch from beside fire pit and swings it into Daniel\u2019s back and he can be heard groaning as it breaks. Tom drags Daniel now limp body over to the fire pit, which still has some hot coals burning. Daniel suddenly kicks fiercely and Tom stumbles into the coals. Daniel stumbles off screen for a moment before returning with a large rock. Tom pulls himself from the fire pit but is struck with the rock and slumps to the side of the fire pit. Daniel slams the rock down on his head several times before falling back onto the ground. He appears to be crying and sits there for almost twenty minutes before eventually recomposing himself and crawling over to the camera.*\n\nDaniel: I need to know why this happened. This footage will absolve me from whatever it is that I may do or at the very least serve as a warning to others.\n\n*Daniel turns the camera to face him as he shuts it off, showing the blood spatters on his face and the Piru standing in the tree line behind him, head cocked to one side. The camera\u2019s next shot is of Daniel shambling up to the manor while it is still night out. He slams his fists on the door several times before Oskar answers it with an irritated look that gives way to surprise as soon as he sees Daniel.*\n\nDaniel: You. Tell me what you did with her. You tell me where it took Lisa!\n\n*Oskar remains speechless and merely stares at Daniel with his mouth slightly agape. Veera can be heard asking who is at the door before coming into the camera\u2019s view. She looks as surprised as Oskar was upon seeing Daniel.*\n\nDaniel: Maybe you know where she is then.\n\nVeera: It cannot be. The Piru did not take you?\n\nDaniel: No. It didn\u2019t. Now explain yourself.\n\nVeera: I-I-yes. Come in and sit down and I will explain everything.\n\n*Daniel slowly walks into the house and follows Veera to the dining area once more, setting the camera on the table.*\n\nVeera: No doubt you have met with the Piru. Our family has a rather long history with it. You understand what it wants and offers correct?\n\nDaniel: Yeah. It offers something in return for something else.\n\nVeera: It desires people the most.\n\nDaniel: Like Lisa.\n\n*Daniel says this in a rather cold and angered way that appears to make Veera lose her composure further.*\n\nVeera: Err\u2026yes. You know that our family has wealth and power. We acquired this many generations ago when one of my ancestors beat the Piru in its game of wits. He acquired a great deal of wealth for our family. Every few generations after that members of the family have offered themselves or a relative in return for furthering our family\u2019s power. We did not always succeed, of course, but it helped continue our legacy. We\u2019ve hit hard times lately. The Piru has raised its cost and games and our family was reduced to four members. Oskar and Tiia had just lost their mother to the Piru and demanded more. I feared it would break the pact it had with our family and kill us all.\n\nDaniel: You found Lisa as a means to prolong your lives then.\n\nVeera: Her mother had never approved of our deals with the Piru and upon learning she was the next one to be gambled she fled to America. I knew she had been pregnant with a child and so I looked into her whereabouts. We did indeed bring Lisa here to appease the Piru for a while longer.\n\nDaniel: So what now? Where is she?\n\nVeera: She may be dead. Even I do not know what the Piru does with all those offered to it. I advise you to go home. I did not know it would spare you but I see how this has affected you. Please, return to America and forget everything you\u2019ve seen here. I will pay for the return trip and offer you a portion of our remaining wealth in return for not digging further.\n\nDaniel: You want me to abandon the woman I love?\n\nVeera: The Piru is a monster. It is powerful. What could you possibly do? Please, just clean yourself up, rest, and return to your home.\n\nDaniel: I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that.\n\nVeera: Then you will die. Leave my house.\n\n*Daniel snatches the camera up and walks to the guest room he had been staying in. He walks over to Lisa\u2019s bag and removes a pendant from it. Daniel begins to cry and slowly walks out of the room and exits the house. After walking halfway down the path he turns back towards the house to see Tiia standing in the upstairs window. He turns and leaves while the camera shuts off due to a dying battery. Suddenly Daniel is back inside the tent and tosses the battery and a camera bag off to the side. He exits the tent, showing that it is now morning out, and returns to the idol.*\n\nDaniel: I\u2019m here to get Lisa back. I\u2019ll play your game.\n\n*Daniel stands there for a minute while nothing happens.*\n\nDaniel: I\u2019ll play your game, monster! I\u2019ll offer you anything you want! So\u2026please, let me get her back\u2026\n\n*A sharp burst of static runs across the camera.*\n\nPiru: (Source of the voice is difficult to pinpoint) I accept. What do you offer?\n\nDaniel: I wish to offer up Veera. \n\nPiru: That is not how this works. You cannot offer her up as she has tainted herself with a prior sacrifice.\n\nDaniel: So she gets away with this?! I want her gone.\n\n*The Piru suddenly emerges from beside Daniel. Its face has changed. Where there was once a blank, wood like texture are now various creases that make the Piru appear like it is grinning.*\n\nPiru: Offer the girl?\n\nDaniel: Who?\n\nPiru: The matriarch\u2019s girl. The one who saw me take her mother.\n\nDaniel: Tiia? Why?\n\nPiru: Because she is innocent to the tragedy you face. Her sacrifice carries weight. Offer her for your beloved\u2019s life.\n\nDaniel: I\u2019ll have to risk an innocent girl to save Lisa?\n\nPiru: Correct. Do not worry though, the matriarch and that boy are forfeit to me now. I no longer require their aid.\n\n*Daniel looks down at the locket in his hand and then back at the Piru, which is leaning even closer towards him.*\n\nDaniel: Fine. I\u2019ll do it.\n\nPiru: We hurt without moving, we poison without touching. We bear the truth and the lies, and we are not to be judged by our size. What are we?\n\nDaniel: Sins.\n\nPiru: Words. The answer is words.\n\nDaniel: Shit!\n\nPiru: The matriarch and her spawn will no longer bother you.\n\n*The Piru turns away from Daniel and lurches towards the idol.*\n\nDaniel: I\u2019m not done! I-I\u2026I offer myself! If I lose you can have me.\n\n*The Piru spins around quickly. The faint creases that formed a grin have deepened and increased the effect. Further creases around the eye sockets have formed as well, giving the Piru an unsettling look.*\n\nPiru: I accept.\n\nDaniel: Then give me your riddle, monster. I don\u2019t have all day.\n\nPiru: What occupation does a man have when what he builds is stronger than the carpenter, the mason, and the shipwright?\n\nDaniel: \u2026stronger than a carpenter\u2026mason\u2026shipwright. Strong. Oh! The priest! A priest! He builds faith!\n\nPiru: The gravedigger.\n\n*The camera is almost overwhelmed completely by distortion as the Piru lunges towards Daniel. In his struggle he drops the camera on the ground. After several minutes the distortion fades and the camera remains lying there for several hours before its battery eventually dies.*\n\n*Action Taken: Spies working within the Zones recovered this footage for us. It is to be reviewed and archived.*\n\n*Analysis: This Piru appears to be unimaginably powerful but only in its domain around the lake. Park workers eventually found the body of Thomas and the camera was recovered shortly after. It appears that everyone else involved in this footage has disappeared, likely taken by the Piru. The Zones have placed observers in the area, likely to dissuade the Piru from interacting with any tourists that may be in the area.*\n\n*Case File: Closed.*\n\n*Greed is a powerful things. So is the blind desire to reclaim a loved one. Remember that, readers of NoSleep.*\n\n*This file being shared is the result of one individual asking if there were any files related to his country of origin. I do hope that he finds this sufficient and chooses to not deal with the Piru. I now leave you with a riddle of my own, NoSleep.*\n\n*If I have this, I will certainly not share it. And if I share it, I no longer have it. What is it?*"

        "body": "*Case File: 015-101*\n\n*Case File Date: 02/07/2009*\n\n*Location: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania*\n\n*Subject: Robin Lutes*\n\n*Entity: The Mannequin*\n\n*Ms. Lutes kept a diary detailing the events that this file covers. Those diary entries are what follow. Please note that The Mannequin detailed in this file does not refer to the Mannequins first conceived through The Hysteria Project.*\n\n*01/11/09*\n\nFinally moved into my new place. I have a section of this empty warehouse to myself. Put up some walls to kind of construct a living space for myself and whatnot. It\u2019s not very traditional but I like it. I have space for my projects and I can afford this. Really can\u2019t argue with that. John and the gang are coming over tonight to help me finish settling in. I\u2019m thinking pizza and drinks at the pizza pub a few blocks over.\n\n*01/15/09*\n\nSo I\u2019ve been rooting around this place and I\u2019ve found something pretty sweet tucked in a supply room on the far side of the warehouse. Most of the doors are locked up so it\u2019s actually kind of curious to see a room that isn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t have really noticed the room either if a draft through the building hadn\u2019t made the door creak so much. Anyway, inside the room I found a ton of art supplies! Pastels, paints, canvas, brushes, tubs of sculpting clay, even a mannequin. I know that this probably belongs to someone but I\u2019m going to call the owner of the warehouse tomorrow just to double check. Can\u2019t blame a girl for trying.\n\n*01/16/09*\n\nLooks like those art supplies are a no go. I called up the owner this morning. He told me that\u2019d he\u2019d get in contact with whoever was renting out that supply room. I think he mentioned that it was some old artist guy who had emigrated here from Germany a long time ago. I\u2019d never heard of him. Regardless, the owner called him up and the guy apparently freaked out and demanded that the room be locked up right away and then admonished the owner for letting someone live in the warehouse. I tell you, some people. As if I\u2019d steal stuff. Clearly he isn\u2019t even using it! Bah. It\u2019s not worth getting upset over it. Some people are just old fashioned. \n\n*01/17/09*\n\nSounds like there\u2019s an animal in the supply room. I keep hearing these scraping noises. Luckily it\u2019s now properly locked. I mean, after hearing all the noises from that room I\u2019d much rather it be locked than I have the supplies inside. Better count my blessings. Oh, I better remember to ask John if he has a spare bat or something. Couldn\u2019t hurt to have something around just in case a rabid raccoon gets in here.\n\n*01/19/09*\n\nHad a strange day. The owner stopped by to see me. Apparently that old artist guy had passed away a few days ago. They believe he had a heart attack or similar episode and this caused him to fall down the stairs and break his body in various places. Sounds pretty macabre to me but the owner said that they\u2019re pretty sure it was the heart attack that killed him first. The man had no one to give his possessions to and apparently the owner wanted to know if I\u2019d like the art supplies from storage. Weird to get them like this but I won\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth. Also, besides the mannequin being knocked over it seems whatever was in the supply room left everything else alone.\n\n*01/20/09*\n\nFinally done taking inventory of all the stuff from the storage room. There was seriously a ton in there and it was high quality too. I almost feel wrong for taking the supplies now, especially that mannequin. I hadn\u2019t noticed before but it\u2019s expertly carved, a little bigger than me with ornate engravings along the boundaries of the joints. Unfortunately, it looks like the previous owner managed to get red paint in the various etches along the arms and head. A mannequin of this quality deserves better. I\u2019m just glad it cleaned up well. I assume it was some sort of water-based paint for how easily it washed away.\n\n*01/21/09*\n\nThere\u2019s definitely an animal in the warehouse. I woke up to a large crash coming from the supply room again. When I unlocked the door I found the window broken. Whatever critter it was must have found a way into the main warehouse as well because I found the mannequin lying on its side. Can\u2019t say that I like this too much. The draft that the broken window is going to leave will be ridiculous. I think I\u2019ll stop by John\u2019s tomorrow and see if he has some extra blankets or fabric I can use to seal off the cracks in the door. That\u2019ll hopefully negate some of the chill.\n\n*01/22/09*\n\nPolice just left. I had been taking out the trash for the night and found a homeless man deceased in the alley behind the warehouse. His body was contorted with sharp L-shaped bends in his limbs. It was\u2026just surreal. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m not more scared. Police said I might be in shock. They\u2019re going to keep a car in the area to watch the surrounding region. Regardless, John is on his way over to check on me. He\u2019s worried. Definitely going to have to borrow a bat off of him now.\n\n*01/23/09*\n\nI think I may be sleepwalking like I did when I was younger. I found myself waking up in the supply room, freezing to death. I noticed on my way back to bed that the mannequin was in a position similar to the way I found the homeless man with its head pointed in the direction of the supply room. I\u2019m thinking that the experience messed me up more than I thought it had. It could be that I\u2019m moving the mannequin around to deal with things I can\u2019t cope with. I also found wounds on my back, cuts of some kind. I really hope I\u2019m not self-destructing. I\u2019ll talk to Carrie about it tomorrow.\n\n*01/24/09*\n\nCarrie is always the best. I told her about all the stuff going on and she feels that the move along with the various events happening have left me unsettled and sinking back into adolescent habits, like my sleepwalking. She\u2019s pretty sure that my subconscious mind is acting out because I\u2019m taking things a bit too well and must secretly be feeling guilty or something. It didn\u2019t make tons of sense to me but I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve been taking things in stride. She gave me some pills of hers from an old prescription. I was told that they weren\u2019t anything serious but they\u2019d allow me a more fit sleep and combat any possible sleepwalking attempts. She\u2019s penning me in at the clinic she works in for an actual evaluation though. God, I love her.\n\n*01/28/09*\n\nI think the pills are making me sick. Having a hard time getting out of bed, having a hard time thinking. My back hurts and really groggy as well. I think the mannequin is moving around. I think it\u2019s watching me. Evil eyes.\n\n*02/03/09*\n\nJust got home from the hospital. It would appear I had a bad reaction to the medication that Carrie gave me. She told me she\u2019s never seen anyone else react so poorly to it. It\u2019s clear that I was completely loopy. I wrote stuff about that darn mannequin moving around, although I did find it standing in that storage room again. I\u2019m guessing I moved it around while I was in a delirious state. Luckily we worked things out with the doctor and Carrie isn\u2019t going to get in any trouble. I\u2019m just glad nothing bad is going to happen. Just noticed the mannequin has red paint stuck in its etchings again. I must\u2019ve done that as well. Oh well, guess I\u2019ll just clean it off once more. I also seem to have some more cuts along my lower back. God knows what I did to get agitate that.\n\n*02/04/09*\n\nSomething awful happened. Carrie\u2019s body was found outside of the warehouse today, in the same back alley as the homeless man. Police came in and questioned me today. I believe they don\u2019t think I\u2019m to blame and they\u2019re going to keep even more people officers in the area. For my protection I hope. I can\u2019t even deal with this right now. I need to call John.\n\n*02/05/09*\n\nPolice are dead. I don\u2019t think it was me though. I\u2019m pretty sure it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m having a hard time focusing right now, and breathing as well. I remember the police coming in and pointing guns in my direction and then I blacked out. Something must\u2019ve happened while I was out because when I came to the two police were in pieces. There was blood on me but I don\u2019t think that means I did it since there was blood everywhere. I think it got on me while I was unconscious. Actually, out of everything in here the mannequin has the most gore on it. That\u2019s strange. I must be in shock again, otherwise I\u2019d be much more scared. Too tired to leave. I wonder why. Time for rest.\n\n*02/06/09*\n\nJohn is dead. Wasn\u2019t me. Mannequin did it. I saw it this time. Caught it moving when it thought I was asleep. It won\u2019t let me leave though, blocks the entrance when I get close to the exit. Mimics my motions too. Look away and look back, suddenly it is closer to me, inviting me it feels like. Felt one of its limbs running down my spine. Turned around and it was at the far side of the room with its head cocked to the side. Toying with me. What\u2019s wrong with my body? Occasionally I zone out and when I come to I find myself in the same pose as the mannequin regardless of how unnatural the pose is. Why am I not scared? I know I should be. The cuts cover my body now. I should be in pain. Why can\u2019t I be afraid?\n\n*02/07/09*\n\nI\u2019m leaving now. I realize these murders were my fault. I can\u2019t believe I believed in something like a mannequin coming to life and killing people. That\u2019s preposterous. To who ever finds this: look for me if you want but I doubt you\u2019ll find me. Just toss out everything in this building: the mannequin, the art, and the corpses. I don\u2019t need them anymore. I need to meet my creator. I will tolerate no one trying to stop me.\n\n*The entries stop here.*\n\n*Analysis: A team arrived at the scene after police discovered the bodies several days later. Various news sources were shut out of the loop and the mannequin was recovered. P-particles are present but inert. It seems likely the girl was used as a host to transfer whatever was residing in the mannequin. It is unknown whether the girl\u2019s consciousness was completely overwritten or if it was a swap and she now lays dormant in the mannequin. Additional testing required but resources and time constraints on current missions are pushing the priority back on this.*\n\n*Case File: On Hold.*\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHey NoSleep, it's Secrets. I've been chatting with people over the last month or so and kinda tossed an update [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/OrganizedSecrets/comments/35kqxl/not_dead_yet/). Long story short I was working three part time jobs to make ends meet and I noticed Tattle take up the reigns so I bounced for awhile. Checked back in a few months to see they had jumped ship or something. Last week I snagged this nice position as a night shift security guard/care worker and I actually have enough free time at work to delve into the Case Files. I have three more Case Files near 100% as well as a Tattle Tale that was sent to me. Please expect those soon. \n\nStay safe NoSleep."

        "title": "Case File #18 The Architect Project",
        "body": "The first thing I noticed is that the usual Case File info was gone. Looks like we have another project on our hands. I believe this project takes place around the same time as The Hysteria Project so that puts it somewhere in the 80\u2019s. \n\n*Doctor Rollins\u2019 early notes on The Architect entity.*\n\nThe Architect is a predator that this organization has been following for many, many years. It is a feral, humanoid being that has been spotted on multiple continents over a rather long period of time. Some within my research team believe it to be multiple entities around the globe but the prevailing theory is that this is a singular entity with a longer lifespan than most creatures native to this planet. It gets its name due to the fact that we believe it holds missing sequences of DNA necessary to prolong life or improve the human specimen. The blueprints to many secrets are surely held within The Architect\u2019s flesh.\n\nAfter several years of cat and mouse I have received word that we have finally cornered The Architect in a small, coastal town in California. This isn\u2019t the best timing as I\u2019ll have to compete with Marlowe\u2019s project for funding but this is the best shot I have at capturing the beast. I\u2019ve sent my approval to make our move. I estimate a twenty five to thirty percent casualty rate for our forces. Acceptable.\n\n*The following is the debriefing from the operative in charge of The Architect\u2019s apprehension.*\n\nThe target was tracked to the town of Advent, California. The beast was in a slaughtering house, pigs I think it was. Not that it matters much. If it was feeding than it was vulnerable so we made our move. I was monitoring my men from a surveillance vehicle in the parking lot. I had mic and cam feeds to all members of my team. I sent in two squads of men, one in back and one from a side entrance. Additional men were posted at all entrances incase it attempted to flee.\n\nIt was Dubois and Flattner that stumbled upon something first, a defiled pig carcass. We had assumed it went into the building to feed but there was no signs of it gnawing on the carcass. Instead, it had covered it in some sort of pulsating mucus. The target got the jump on them while they were inspecting the mucus. I find myself both impressed and horrified with how efficiently it dispatched the two men. Before I knew it their vitals were flat lining and I was staring at two camera feeds pointed toward the ground. That was two good men killed and I still only had vague hints at what I was dealing with. \n\nI updated the men on what had happened. Told those on the perimeter to tighten their watch and advised everyone in the building to stay extra attentive. I\u2019m not one for throwing lives away. Jennings and Winthrop were the remaining members of Squad Three. I could tell from their monitors that they were both shaken, so I switched them out for Squad Four and put them on perimeter duty. \n\nThe target proceeded to engage us in games of cat and mouse, skirting by the men and making feints. It was trying to mess the men up and make its escape. Or so I had thought. I decided to get more aggressive and send Sancho and Farrell down a hallway that with more enter/exit points than I was comfortable with. I should have known it would be a trap. Those two never made it back out, skewered by the target. However, this time Sancho managed to get a solid look at the target. It was a humanoid, gave off a skinned human look. The eyes were off, reminded me of black holes if that makes sense. They were the absence of light, the absence of good. It was gaunt, with long limbs, and had intimidatingly long claws. It looked like all five fingers had possessed near foot long claws but at some point the thumb and pinkie claws had broken off of each had and were much smaller in comparison. It also had a fanged mouth that reminded me of a shark with rows upon rows of teeth. This thing was a predator but I refused to let us be the prey.\n\nNow I had an idea of what we were dealing with. Limbs and bodies like that lend themselves towards leaping attacks. Those teeth are good for gnashing and opponent but with the smaller size of its mouth it was going to be relying on them to kill in a fight. I assumed that it had some ability at climbing. This led me to a proper strategy for attack. Squads are to regroup into fours, two men watch for above normal entity heights while the other two maintain aim on the usual perimeters. \n\nThis strategy seemed effective as the target\u2019s hit and run attempts effectively shut down. I decided that the time to end this was at hand and sent in the soldiers with the heavier capture gear. I believe it was modified stun equipment as well as some type of netting made from various metals. The target eventually cornered to a locker room and we were able to take it in to HQ. While no more deaths occurred we did have another five soldier injured, and three of them will sustain lasting injury. In this operative\u2019s opinion it is imperative that we continue to learn how to fight these beings. Humanity cannot be outclassed.\n\nJohn Stormer\n\n*The debriefing ends there. Operative Stormer is to be assessed and possibly moved to Strategic Solutions.*\n\n*Doctor Rollins\u2019 assessment of The Architect.*\n\nIt would appear that the stories featuring The Architect bare some truth after all. While we have it in confinement I\u2019ve been able to both observe it and take blood samples. The Architect excels at psychological warfare regardless of whether it knows it. The being will bob and weave its head to ensure that it is always at eye level with its target. It then uses those absences of light it calls eyes to unnerve and break down its target. Several of the researchers have requested time off or tried to leave the project. I will institute a new shift system to alleviate the stress that The Architect creates. \n\nThe blood samples confirm my suspicion that the subject has prolonged life. Given enough time I may be able to synthesize something compatible with humans. I will have to draw up a list of candidates for initial testing. Another curious note is the altered behavior of the subject. With what has been recorded of it from the ops team I have reason to believe that The Architect may be trying to breed. I have sent for livestock to be brought in. I do believe I have an idea. \n\nAs a side note I\u2019ve lost some of my staff to Marlowe\u2019s project needing volunteers. Curse that man and his meddling.\n\n*Doctor Rollins\u2019 notes from several weeks later.*\n\nWe have a baby on the way. When I saw the footage from the target acquisition mission I thought I had found signs that it was trying to breed. The process is very parasitic in nature and was fascinating to watch actually. First The Architect took down the cow that we had introduced into its holding chamber. It took great care in not killing the beast but it did break a limb on the cow. I assume this was to keep the animal from escaping or hurting itself after being impregnated. It was then that something bizarre happened. A sheet of cartilage that I had thought was for protection split and gave way to a coiled up tendril. The Architect used this tendril to pierce into the cow\u2019s side and presumably insert itself into the womb. Fluids were then pumped into the cow. The process took a little over ten minutes and then The Architect removed itself from the now bloated cow.\n\nRemoval of the cow actually posed an issue. The subject became fiercely protective of the cow, I assume because of paternal instincts, and was aggressive to all who came close to the chamber. In what I deemed a risky yet necessary move we flooded the room with various chemicals to render The Architect unconscious. This could have infected the offspring but I could see no other measures for quickly removing the cow and offspring from the holding chamber. The beast has been moved to its own chamber while we await the birth. I am now going to focus my studies on the genetic properties of The Architect\u2019s DNA.\n\n*Subsequent update from Doctor Rollins.*\n\nAfter two weeks of gestation I can confirm that the offspring is about to be born. The cow has become swollen beyond measure and I am certain it won\u2019t survive the birthing process.\n\nI\u2019ve also locked down several key strains in the DNA that I feel can be bonded to humans to produce some sort of metahuman. I am looking for volunteers now.\n\n*Doctor Rollins\u2019 notes concerning the DNA infusion.*\n\nFive volunteers have opted for the treatment: Winthrop, Jennings, Hoffer, Adams, and Scott are the last names. The procedure could be dangerous as I have to bond The Architect\u2019s DNA with various protein chains within the men. It is highly likely that their bodies will reject this treatment leading to sickness or death and yet I commend them on their bravery.\n\n*Week One*\n\nIt has been one week since the treatment has started and everyone seems to be responding well except for Adams. His body shows signs of what I can only call degradation. It is under my assumption that the DNA introduced to his system may actually be overcoming his natural defenses rather easily. We plan to reintroduce untainted DNA we collected before the bonding process but it may already be too late for him.\n\n*Week Two*\n\nWe lost Adams, although this was to be expected. His body simply could not handle The Architect\u2019s DNA strains and he fell apart over the week, almost quite literally. Hoffer and Jennings have both came down with high-grade fevers. This could simply imply their bodies are fighting off the DNA but it could be something more severe. I plan to give them fresh injections of both their own DNA and DNA from The Architect. With any luck we can take advantage of this situation and there will be a healthy bond. If not\u2026well, we will still have two remaining subjects. Winthrop and Scott show no signs of any changes. It\u2019s all rather curious how it\u2019s affected the men differently. We must be sure to carefully monitor the subjects.\n\n*Week Three*\n\nThis week\u2019s casualty seems to be Scott. I would\u2019ve pegged either Hoffer or Jennings for death since they are still struggling against an astonishingly high fever. Both men are now practically confined to bed rest all hours of the day. Scott\u2019s death is another peculiar case and shows me that we will need to be even more thorough in our observations if repeated treatments are to be done. We went to his room to check up on him after he had finished his morning exercise routine and found him dead on the floor. There were no wounds on marks on his body and early reports say that besides the introduced DNA in his system there is nothing else wrong with him. Perhaps it was suddenly too taxing on his system, or maybe something else occurred on a level we\u2019re just not able to detect. For now I\u2019m having his body preserved so that we can continue studying the corpse for a while longer.\n\n*Week Four*\n\nHoffer and Jennings have finally recovered from their fevers. Better still, it looks like the DNA has bonded with their systems correctly. There is relatively little sign of the body fighting back and they are coexisting. While we won\u2019t know the fruits of these injections for a few more years to come I am willing to play that waiting game. I\u2019ll let Marlowe scurry around making monsters and scrabbling to gain favor. Conversely, we\u2019ve seen little to no change with Winthrop. His DNA and that of The Architect remain completely separate. He has become more withdrawn around the researchers but this may have less to do with the project and more with the psychological trauma he faced while subduing The Architect. We\u2019ll keep a close eye on him.\n\n*The Progeny\u2019s Birth & Training*\n\nThe cow \u201cbirthed\u201d the parasitic offspring after three and a half weeks of gestation. Without going into detail I will say that the cow did not live and that the process seems to ensure the host\u2019s death. The Progeny, as I\u2019ve decided to name it, proceeded to devour the corpse. That\u2019s actually a similar process to many other species on the planet that rely on their mother\u2019s death to have food and sustenance until they are stronger. The entity is of slightly larger than average size to a human baby. It did gain many of its faculties after several hours and was capable of traversing the containment room we had set up.\n\nWe\u2019ve also found a suitable cocktail of medications to serve as a safe, yet effective means of subduing the entity. At its smaller size we have to respect the capacity it will soon have for killing but also realize it is in a fragile state. I ran early tests and learned that the entity actually possessed significant mental abilities. I believed we could train it and started it on tests that were usually reserved for lab rats. I\u2019m glad to report that The Progeny aced all early tests and is now being tested on the level of chimpanzees and apes. After the entity has matured to a state closer to The Architect I am sure that it will be suitable for use in missions. I\u2019d be so bold as to offer it for more complex missions as well. Given the right equipment I feel it could be quite a valuable asset. I\u2019ve already drawn up plans for various attachments to replace the claws it has. \n\n*Final Notes*\n\nI\u2019m keeping this bit of the project under wraps for now. With The Progeny progressing at an unexpectedly fast rate I feel that gathering more information on Hoffer and Jennings is in order. I\u2019ll make sure both get moved to field ops positions to see if there are any changes to their behavior and skills. Something big is happening in Antarctica. I have a few sources that tell me a one-man infiltration mission is being headed up to recover an artifact of some power. I plan to champion Hoffer to the position in hopes that I can gather more data. I\u2019ve also heard stirrings of a newly formed branch to counter paranormal serial killers. This could prove an interesting push for Jennings. I\u2019ll also have an inside man in the new department. As for The Architect, I plan to keep it in stasis until it is needed. \n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nWe finally learn about The Architect Project. It honestly seems like a lifetime ago that I read about Marlowe's rival during The Hysteria Project. I wonder in the end which was the more successful...\n\nRegardless, stay safe NoSleep."

We\u2019re conducting a separate investigation of those who previously questioned you and feel this could aid in this missing person case.\n\nCassondra: I\u2026I understand ma\u2019am. \n\nI: We\u2019re going to start at a different point than the others did however.\n\nC: Okay?\n\nI: We know that your boyfriend, Benjamin has been missing for\u2026how long now?\n\nC: Well, I went to visit him for the first time in a long while and found that he wasn\u2019t living at the location he told me.\n\nI: And this was when?\n\nC: This would have been two weeks ago now.\n\nI: Two weeks. Alright. We\u2019d like you to take us back to when you first started dating Benjamin. \n\nC: Alright? If you think this will help. Um\u2026well, we met back in high school. We hung around in the same social circle and eventually caught each other\u2019s eye I guess.\n\nI: And how was your relationship?\n\nC: Normal enough I guess. I mean, Ben has always had a bit of a temper and I\u2019m not that passive myself. Fights were inevitable. But we stuck through it, you know? \n\nI: Sounds like you two had some differences.\n\nC: Sure, but it wasn\u2019t anything worth leaving him over. He was a good enough guy who just had some issues with anger. I mean, it\u2019s not like he ever laid a hand on me.\n\nI: How long life go on like this?\n\nC: For a while. A little over a year I\u2019d say until the\u2026(She stops midsentence, looks distressed.)\n\nI: Accident?\n\nC: (Dejected and distant.) Yes, the accident.\n\nI: Would you care to tell me the details of the accident?\n\nC: It was winter and I was driving along some rural roads. Ben was with me. We hit a patch of ice after some time and well\u2026the car flipped over trapping Ben and I.\n\nI: But you survived.\n\nC: We both did somehow. I remember Ben shouting to wake me up, the smell of oil, ringing in my ears. All the blood had gone to my head. He encouraged me to climb out and live. God, I loved him for that, for driving me onwards.\n\nI: And you both made it out unscathed?\n\nC: When I finally crawled from the wreckage I found Ben already out and leaning against the car. I remember him smiling at me and then passing out. I only had a few minor wounds and went to the local hospital to get patched up but he had some serious injuries\u2026\n\nI: I see. What happened then?\n\nC: Eventually Benjamin was released from the hospital and we went back to the way things were. Kind of.\n\nI: Kind of?\n\nC: Ben got\u2026distant. Like, not from me. We were closer than ever but he stopped seeing people. I remember he wouldn\u2019t go out in public and most of our dates were in secluded places. He switched to being home schooled as well.\n\nI: What followed high school?\n\nC: I remember being so upset that Ben had found a college to go to down in Georgia. I had already gotten into Penn State when he had told me.\n\nI: So you weren\u2019t going to be able to see him often. \n\nC: Not at all. For the next three years I only saw him once. He drove up to my place at State College and stayed for a week. It was really great.\n\nI: You are in your final year of college now, right?\n\nC: Yeah. Ben and I were both going to graduate and then find a place together.\n\nI: So what was it that brought you down to Georgia so close to graduation?\n\nC: Ben stopped texting and calling me all of the sudden. I let it go for a few days but then I got really worried.\n\nI: So you drove down to see him?\n\nC: Yeah, he had given me an address for his house.\n\nI: Did he live with anyone else?\n\nC: No. He stayed by himself in this little place on the edge of town. (Bitter.) Or so he told me.\n\nI: Or so he told you? Was that not the truth?\n\nC: Apparently not. When I finally got here to check out his place all I found was an abandoned house. It looked like it had been empty for years. I mean, how could Ben lie to me about where he was staying?\n\nI: I\u2019m sorry to hear that. I\u2019m guessing you went to the police after that.\n\nC: Yeah. A few of the officers told me that the house had been derelict for years and that they\u2019d try there best to locate Ben. I remember them planning to send a few officers to the college and to call up his mom back home. Not that talking to her will do much good. They weren\u2019t even on speaking terms. But that was all a few weeks ago. They moved me to this facility so that I\u2019d have a place to stay but I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on or even what this facility is. \n\nI: They have you at a hospital, Cassondra.\n\nC: What kind of hospital bars the doors shut? I feel like I\u2019m in prison.\n\nI: This is a mental ward.\n\nC: (Agitated.) For like, crazy people? Why keep me here? Isn\u2019t that kind of dangerous? \n\nI: Cassondra, Benjamin is dead.\n\nC: (Panicked.) Dead? But how? Where did they find him? Why wasn\u2019t I notified sooner?\n\nI: Miss Bailey, could you please tell me about the last few texts between you and Benjamin?\n\nC: (In tears.) Oh-okay. Uhm\u2026I remember I was sitting in some caf\u00e9 at during lunch and him and I were bullshitting about finals coming up. I saw a mutual friend from high school walk in and told him I was going to go talk to her real quick. Ben freaked out for some reason. \n\nI: Do you remember why?\n\nC: (Sniffling.) No, but here in my phone the texts get really\u2026weird now that I think about it.\n\nI: How so?\n\nC: The final text I got from him said \u201cDON\u2019T TALK TO HER. SHE\u2019S LYING. DON\u2019T LET HER GET TO YOU.\u201d in all caps. That was all he said to me. Now please tell me what happened to Ben.\n\nI: Did you go talk to that mutual friend?\n\nC: (Beginning to sob once more.) No? Yes? I can\u2019t really remember. Please. Where is Ben?\n\nI: Ben died years ago Cassondra. He never made it out of that car crash that you survived.\n\nC: What? How could you say that?! I\u2019ve been talking to him for years! I\u2019ve seen him!\n\nI: Cassondra, you know that friend you saw at the caf\u00e9?\n\nC: What the fuck about her?!\n\nI: You mentioned Benjamin to her. Told her about how the two of you are keeping up. She apparently she was quite appalled and thought it was in poor taste for you to be talking about him.\n\nC: (Softly.) \u2026what?\n\nI: When she told you to quit it and that Benjamin was dead you attacked her, slammed her against the wall a few times before running off. Police went to your apartment but you weren\u2019t there, presumably on your way here.\n\nC: But I have texts from him! Can\u2019t you see them?!\n\n*She holds the phone in front of the interviewer\u2019s face for several moments before letting out an odd squeal.*\n\nC: Look! It\u2019s a text from him! I told you it was real!\n\n*She takes a moment to look at the text before slumping far down into her seat.*\n\nI: What\u2019s wrong Cassondra?\n\nC: (Voice wavering.) \u2026did you put him up to this?\n\nI: Up to what?\n\nC: The text says\u2026\u201dGo ahead, tell her about the crazy man texting you. All she\u2019ll see is a long dead number.\u201d Why would you make him say that to me?\n\nI: Cassondra, that\u2019s an aspect of your personality trying to get you to see the truth.\n\nC: No. Get out. Get. Out.\n\n*Cassondra flips the table and the interviewing lets out a sigh and slowly leaves the room.*\n\n*Interviewer\u2019s Notes*\n\nDay Five of trying to get though to Cassondra has resulted in the same outcome. Any time I try to push the thought of Benjamin being deceased she retreats further into the fiction. Today was odd though. \u201cHe\u2019s\u201d never tried to talk to her mid-session before. This could be considered progress of some sort. I will continue to try and get through to her over the next several days. After that she is to be transferred to a facility I\u2019ve never heard of, some \u201cmedical four-forty\u201d or some nonsense. I heard they specialize in experimental, cutting edge treatment and research. I really hope they can help this girl. Cassondra deserves better than to be living a lie, pining for someone no longer alive.\n\n*Cassie Bailey has been transferred to Testing Bed 010. She is to be used in a mass study to analyze mental trauma. The proper papers to placate loved ones have already been sent.*\n\n*Subject: Acquired.*\n\nThis was originally the document that was located in the twentieth spot of the Case Files. Due to work picking up with promotion junk and overtime I decided to release this first as the actual Case File 19 is much more lengthy and taking a bit more time than I'd like. Now, as I mentioned way back when, the folders I snagged aren't just reports of horrific incidents or gruesome experiments. I've seen legal documents, nonviolent test results, financial reports, inventories, and lists of personnel. A lot of it isn't really NoSleep sharable but I thought that this made the cut. I gotta get back to my shift now but you guys keep on keeping on. \n\nStay safe NoSleep."

At some point he managed to take a crew entirely comprised of friends to Japan to further study the supernatural found in Japanese folklore and urban legends. He and his friends actually stumbled upon something and their story has been recorded in the various forms of media that follow.*\n\n*A lone videotape was found with a crew member\u2019s body. This tape contained footage from the cameras that the crew brought. Stranger still is the fact that the footage is out of order regardless of the timestamp or info associated with the footage. The footage is also taken from multiple sources, further confusing the situation. There is a possibility that the new arrangement of the footage could have been engineered by an entity, the original finder of the tape, or the Japanese Government. Further investigation required.*\n\n*Video footage shows the man who would be identified as Jamie Lyndhurst walking down a suburban street with a friend. The camera was held at an angle facing the two young men as they walked and talked. Quality comes across as grainy and stuttered.

Come on man. Still on about that? We\u2019ll find spooks eventually. You just gotta keep the faith up. Until then we collect some footage, get some cash money, and continue the quest.\n\nJamie: Just feels off Tobias. We\u2019re supposed to be paranormal investigators and yet here we are selling stock footage to some assholes that think a few spooky shots are ghost hunting.\n\nTobias: Look man, the whole crew has your back.

Aokigahara, the Japanese Suicide Forest. You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a location containing as much death.\n\nGirl Two: What about the sites of the nuclear blasts? A bunch of people died then.\n\nJamie: Look, we\u2019re not doing a history lesson now. Besides, searching a city is a lot harder than searching a forest with decades of negativity attached to it. I\u2019m certain there has to be something here. For once\u2026\n\nGirl One: (Approaches Jamie to comfort him.) Jamie\u2026\n\nJamie: Beth, I\u2019m alright. I just need proof. We\u2019re going to do this Scooby-Doo style guys. Beth and I will follow a trail up to the caverns and check those out. Tobias, there\u2019s a lake nearby and I need you to check there. Could have supernatural hauntings related to the drowning that occurred there. Norm and Candice, I\u2019d like you guys to check out the actual woods. A lot of the hangings took place there. This is our shot guys, keep your cameras going and film what you ca-\n\n*The footage is overcome with static. A visage of some sort can almost be seen though the static. It suddenly cuts to what is assumed to be an earlier time with Jamie talking to Beth and Norm in a kitchen area.* \n\nJamie: I was talking to T earlier today.\n\nNorm: Tobias? Why do you even keep him around?\n\nJamie: Look, Norm, he\u2019s my childhood friend and a fellow believer. I wouldn\u2019t have ended up where I am today without him being with me from the start. He may not have the technical know-how that you have but he\u2019s got spirit.\n\nNorm: Alright, alright. Point taken.\n\nJamie: Anyway, I finally got the funding for us to go to Japan.\n\nNorm: What, really?\n\nBeth: Aw yeah! I knew there was going to be some good news.\n\nJamie: We\u2019ve been saving up a lot for this trip ourselves but do you remember those guys that T got us in contact with a few months back? The ghost hunter guys from Cali?\n\nBeth: Yeah. He\u2019s got a cousin or something that runs around with them right?\n\nJamie: Exactly. They got picked up by some network looking for the real deal. T\u2019s cousin let them know about us and we may be signed on as a second, separate team.\n\nNorm: Yeah! This is exactly what we needed.\n\nBeth: Oh Jamie, this is awesome.\n\nJamie: When I talked to them and told them what our current plans and ideas were I mentioned the Japan trip. They told me that\u2019d make an excellent first episode for our team and are agreeing to fund the remaining costs. We\u2019re going to Japan folks!\n\n*Static cut off. Norm and Candice are walking on a trail through the woods. It is now almost completely dark out.*\n\nCandice: I\u2019m actually afraid we\u2019ll find something this time, Norm.\n\nNorm: I know! Wouldn\u2019t that be something?\n\nCandice: I guess. I mean, people come here to die right? Who are we to disturb that?\n\nNorm: It\u2019s in the pursuit of knowledge my dear sweet Candy. Do it for science!\n\nCandice: (Laughing) Professor Norman, the ghost hunter extraordinaire, eh?\n\nNorm: It has a certain ring to it.\n\nCandice: Hey, wait. What\u2019s that?\n\n*Candice motions to a tree just out of the camera\u2019s view. Norm swings the camera around and a silhouette can be seen. The two slowly walk closer and the silhouette is shown to be a couple bound together and hung from their necks. Candice lets out a scream and the static returns. Regular static remains before strange footage starts to play. It appears to be footage taken of a young Japanese couple. The two are walking down some city street and appear to be laughing and playing around. She says something to the man holding the camera but the audio is missing from this portion. After a minute or so of this footage it cuts to Jamie and Beth at the entrance to a cave.*\n\n*Additional note: This footage is bizarre. Clearly it comes from another camera other than the three that the team had on them for their trek into Aokigahara. The whole time this clip plays there\u2019s a constant barrage of static on the left side of the footage and in the middle of this static appears to be a silhouette of some kind. It looks kind of like a person walking towards the camera.*\n\nBeth: Do you think the others will be okay?\n\nJamie: What do you mean? They\u2019re all professionals.\n\n*Beth gives him a disbelieving glance as they enter the cave.*\n\nBeth: Professional, huh?\n\nJamie: Well, as professional as you can be as an amateur pursuer of the paranormal.\n\nBeth: Alright, if you say so Mister Leader. So what\u2019s the deal with these caves?\n\nJamie: The caves during the day are popular tourist spots but I\u2019m hoping that their proximity to all the suicides will allow us to catch something on film, maybe some spectral lights, or globes. Although a full on ghost would definitely be best.\n\n*Distant screaming can be heard coming from the exit to the caves.*\n\nBeth: Was that-\n\nJamie: Shit, let\u2019s go!\n\n*The two turn and exit the cave while static slowly builds and overtakes the screen. This static gives way to Tobias walking along a stream.*\n\nTobias: -it\u2019s alright. They want to leave T be to do his own thing that\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll get some good footage. I mean, it was my cousin who got us this gig. You hearing this Jay? I know you\u2019re watching the footage right now and laughing at me. Poor, old T walking alone by the river. That\u2019s some romantic shit and you know it! Ahah.\n\n*Screams can be heard off in the distance although much louder than at the caves. Tobias says nothing but cuts into the forest towards the direction of the scream. There is surprisingly no static this time as the footage abruptly returns to Jamie\u2019s camera as he and Beth are running through the woods.*\n\nJamie: Come on Beth, this way.\n\nBeth: Jamie, slow down!\n\n*The two run in relative silence for several minutes before they reach a grove among the forest where the rest of the crew is found. Candice is being held by Norm on the far side of the grove where the tree line begins to thicken while Tobias is inspecting the bodies that they found in the previous cut of footage.*\n\nTobias: Hey! You guys made it! Must\u2019ve heard the screams too.\n\nNorm: I\u2019m pretty sure the people back in town heard Candice.\n\nCandice: Stop it (gasp) guys. (gasp) Those are (gasp) dead people\u2026\n\n*Jamie and Beth walk over to the hanging couple. The bodies show no immediate signs of decay and the couple appear to be the young from the earlier clip that cut in.*\n\nBeth: Whoa. Who are they?\n\nTobias: I dunno yet. I thought about checking their pockets for some ID but was waiting.\n\nBeth: Waiting?\n\nTobias: Guess I got a lil nervous alright? Touching dead people isn\u2019t exactly something I figured I\u2019d be doing today.\n\nJamie: No problem T. I\u2019ll do it.\n\nBeth: Jamie\u2026\n\nJamie: It\u2019s okay Beth. I just want to know who they are\u2026\n\n*Norm walks over to the trio.*\n\nNorm: Actually, I have a better idea: let\u2019s film this.\n\nTobias: Seriously, bro?\n\nBeth: Norm! What the fuck?\n\nJamie: So\u2026you were thinking that too?\n\nBeth: Jamie? What do you mean?\n\nJamie: Look guys, these people are dead. We can\u2019t hurt them any further. Maybe this is the missing link to finding the truth about the supernatural. We\u2019ve never found freshly dead bodies in a suicide forest before. I say we set up the equipment and do a full investigation right now.\n\nTobias: Jay, I\u2019m not gonna tell you that this is a bad idea, but this is a bad idea. We aren\u2019t no special victims unit. We don\u2019t do dead bodies and crime scenes.\n\nJamie: We don\u2019t do anything Tobias! We never find anything! And I\u2019m sick of it. This is an opportunity. We aren\u2019t parading these bodies around or defiling them! We\u2019re just going to investigate. We can call the police after we\u2019re done.\n\nNorm: Er, no. I think we should skip calling the police. I don\u2019t want to chance them even thinking we were here. Too many questions and we\u2019re just a group of foreigners.\n\nJamie: Fine, we check this out. Carefully. After that we can bounce. So can we please set up the equipment?\n\nBeth: I just want you to know that I think you\u2019re making a huge mistake this time Jamie. Something feels off about this.\n\nTobias: I\u2019m with her, man. I don\u2019t think we should meddle.\n\nJamie: Just set up the equipment.\n\nBeth: Fine.\n\n*Beth and Tobias walk out of frame with Tobias mumbling something under his breath. Candice remains on the far side of the clearing in a state far from coherent. Jamie turns the camera around to face the couple. When the camera swings back up to the couple it is shown that the hung women\u2019s position has changed from the last time she was in frame. Her head has shifted to be almost looking right at the camera. Previous shots of her show her head face pointed towards the ground with her face obscured by her hair. None of the crew makes any comments on the corpse changing position. The camera zooms in on the woman\u2019s face before the footage suddenly turns blurry and hard cuts to the group talking in a van, presumably on their way back from the forest.*\n\nNorm: So we\u2019re following up on that card?\n\nJamie: Yeah. We don\u2019t have the equipment to analyze the footage for any spectral happenings until we get back to Tokyo.\n\nTobias: Still, this is weird right? A murdered couple has a business card for some paranormal shop? They had no keys, no i.d., nothing. Are we sure they weren\u2019t murdered or something?\n\nBeth: (Sarcastic tone) Well\u2026if they were I\u2019m just sure they\u2019ll just be dying to tell us in ghost form.\n\nJamie: I know you\u2019re pissed off Beth but that actually might happen.\n\nBeth: I just feel like a grave robber or something Jamie. I feel gross.\n\nJamie: Beth, I know it\u2019s not standard practice for us but we didn\u2019t defile any bodies or anything. We took a peek at some corpses, filmed them a little, and then we got out of there.\n\nBeth: Fine. Whatever. Fair enough. Just\u2026don\u2019t talk about this much around Candice. Poor girl is passed out from all the fear and stress.\n\nJamie: Deal. We won\u2019t mention it around her again. For now, let\u2019s go check out that shop. It\u2019s a bit out of the way but we should reach it by morning. The rest of you can feel free to catch some sleep if you want. I don\u2019t expect you guys to pull an all nighter with me.\n\nTobias: Shit man, you know it\u2019s shotgun\u2019s duty to stay up with the driver. I got you.\n\nJamie: (Laughter) Thanks man.\n\n*The van hits a bump and the camera flips over and faces the back seats. From this angle you can see that Norm and Beth are in the middle seats, both of them shifting positions to try and get some sleep. Candice is in the back seat passed out. Sitting beside Candice and stroking her hair is the Japanese woman who had been hung. The color has left her body and she is shown staring right at the camera once more. The other people in the van appear to still not be able to see her.*\n\nNorm: Tobias, could you please pick up the camera? I\u2019d hate for it to get damaged.\n\nTobias: Oh shit, no problem man. I didn\u2019t even see it flip over. Hold on a sec, forgot to turn it off. (Laughs)\n\nJamie: Good catch. Swap out the battery okay? I want all of our cameras at full power in case we catch any leads at this shop.\n\n*Tobias shuffles with the camera for several moments before turning it to face him for a brief moment. The dead woman from the back seat was now looming to the side of Tobias\u2019 headrest. Her head then cocks to the side and her mouth opens slightly. The expression seems to be mixture of slight surprise and malice. Tobias then shuts the camera off and it progresses to footage of the group outside of the paranormal shop. Something to note is that the woman once again never took her eyes off the camera and the other people in the van still can\u2019t seem to see her.*\n\n*Jamie is at the door of the paranormal shop, the others crowded around him. Tobias has the camera. It appears to either still be night or early morning due to the lighting but the store is open regardless. The shop itself is located down in a rather downtrodden alley way.*\n\nCandice: Can anyone remind me why we\u2019re here again?\n\nJamie: We just have a lead on some supernatural occurrences. Now, I don\u2019t know the validity of this place so how about only Tobias and I go in? The three of you can go wait in the van okay? T and I have been in scrapes before and I just don\u2019t want the rest of you getting hurt over this.\n\nBeth: Finally taking what I said to heart then?\n\nJamie: You know I\u2019d never intentionally put you guys in more danger than comes with chasing the supernatural.\n\nCandice: Did something happen? I feel out of the loop\u2026\n\n*Norm, Beth, and Candice start to walk away as Tobias and Jamie turn towards the shop.*\n\nBeth: Nothing big happened, sweetie. Jamie and I just had a small disagreement about how he\u2019s been pursuing\u2026 (Fades out)\n\nTobias: Alright Jay, I got you.\n\nJamie: Thanks T, but let\u2019s not have a repeat of Toronto.\n\nTobias: (Laughs) Anything but another Toronto.\n\n*The two walk into the store to see lots of Japanese occult paraphernalia on display such as paper charms and good luck symbols. In the back of the dingy shop is an elderly man sitting in a chair. He looks over to the two of them with an almost expectant look on his face.*\n\nElderly Man: Why hello there. American correct?\n\n*The man speaks proper English, only a hint of his accent showing through.*\n\nJamie: Oh thank God you speak English. Uh, yeah. A few of us are from the States and the rest of us from Canada (Voice trailing off) but I don\u2019t really think you care about that. Yeah.\n\nElderly Man: Welcome to my shop. Not too many people find me tucked away back here.\n\nJamie: Well, actually we found your card.\n\n*Jamie presents the card to the man.* \n\nJamie: We actually found this over at Aokigahara. We know a young couple who had it on them. We\u2019re actually here investigating the paranormal and this looked like a good opportunity for us to try. Anyway, err, do you know anything about the couple that came here?\n\nElderly Man: I thought you were investigating the paranormal? Why would you want to know more about the people who gave you this card?\n\nTobias: We didn\u2019t get a lot of information out of the two. Frankly, it was a little suspicious. \n\nElderly Man: (Laughter) Do not worry. I already know that the two of passed on.\n\n*There\u2019s an abrupt and brief clip of the couple hanging from the trees. It appears to be footage that the group took earlier.*\n\nJamie: Wait. What? How do you know that?\n\nElderly Man: Because I was the one who told them that they would be dead before the week ended. Tell me, how did they die? If they traveled to Aokigahara I can only assume it was suicide.\n\nTobias: Yeah, that\u2019s right. Hung themselves. That card was the only thing on them. Now, I know we weren\u2019t exactly telling you the whole story a moment ago but you knowing they\u2019d die is more than a little suspect.\n\n*A clip of the couple lying awake in a darkened bedroom begins to play. The two are sitting up against the backboard, embracing each other with a rather fearful look on their faces.*\n\nElderly Man: I did not kill them, I assure you. I merely advised them on supernatural\u2026issues that the couple were having. This led me to the conclusion that they would not survive the week. I am afraid that I do not know their names or even who they were.\n\nJamie: Okay. Then why did they come to you? They had to of at least told you about what they were experiencing for you to advise them. \n\nTobias: Yeah, and how did they find this place anyway? Like you said, it\u2019s kind of a hole in the wall.\n\nElderly Man: As for how they found me, well\u2026 \n\n*The old man points to the card in Jamie\u2019s hand and smiles.*\n\nElderly Man: They found that very card. I was told it was passed on to them from another prior client.\n\n*A clip suddenly plays of the couple approaching a suburban home. The man is holding a handheld camera and it can be surmised that the woman is as well. It appears to be the middle of day and yet every window is darker than would seem natural. The door is slightly ajar but the couple still knocks several times before entering. The lack of sound in this clip becomes apparent when one sees the repeated knocks on the door and the man who appears to be calling out to whoever lived at the residence. After several minutes of this the man cautiously pushes the door open and the two enter the house. The house is tidy if lacking a bit of character and it appears that the power is out. The man suddenly puts his sleeve up to his face to cover his mouth and nose. There appears to be stench as the camera fidgets around signifying that the woman must also be covering her face. The two eventually approach a door in the back and this appears to be where the smell is originating. The man is visibly shaken and retching. He suddenly pushes open the door and the corpse of a man sitting in a chair can be seen. The corpse has a plastic bag tightly over his face and flies cover large portions of the body. The man picks a small card up off the floor, which appears to be the one he has in his possession later. The two jump at a supposed loud noise and they take off running out of the house. The footage slowly fills with static and a more clearly humanoid figure can be seen facing the screen. It appears to be female in shape.*\n\nJamie: And the supernatural occurrence?\n\nElderly Man: A malevolent force was stalking them, something bent on harming them. I gave them a few options on how to preserve their lives but they did not seem happy with what I told them.\n\nJamie: Do you know what caused them to encounter this being in the first place?\n\nElderly Man: The man that you found\u2026he had a previous lover. He told me that she had been quite sickly and eventually died to illness. Before she had passed away he promised her that he would not love again. The man kept that promise for a year or two before falling in love with the woman you had found him with. His previous lover was keeping him to that promise even in death. Her spirit was causing many disruptions in their lives and I saw the warning signs that she had marked them for death.\n\n*The footage of the couple cowering in bed is shown once again but this time there is a woman standing outside the window by their bed staring at the two of them. She\u2019s a different person than the one that keeps popping up in the crew\u2019s footage but is behaving in a similar manner, except she is staring at the couple and not directly at the camera in every shot.*\n\nTobias: Shit man, I can\u2019t imagine the new girl taking that well\u2026\n\nElderly Man: (Smiles once more) She did not like the things that she had heard. I vividly remember her cursing their fate and the two left my shop on rather\u2026hostile terms.\n\nJamie: And they just killed themselves to avoid this spirit? Couldn\u2019t they have tried whatever advice you had given them?\n\nElderly Man: One of my solutions was to take their own lives, so they did take at least part of my advice. I\u2019m afraid that everything I told them wasn\u2019t guaranteed to work and that their most likely fate was a painful death.\n\nTobias: That\u2019s harsh\u2026\n\nElderly Man: But let us forget them for the time being. The police will find their bodies soon enough and they will be processed and put to rest. What is it that you two have come to seek other than them.\n\nJamie: We document the paranormal. T, I mean, Tobias and I have been chasing after ghosts and monsters for as long as I can remember. We want to find proof.\n\nElderly Man: But I can see that you already believe, what proof could you possibly want?\n\nJamie: (Lets out a short laugh) The proof\u2026isn\u2019t for us. We\u2019re making a documentary. I want everyone else to believe what we already know to be true.\n\nElderly Man: Ahhh. Well in that case you are in luck.\n\nJamie: Really?!\n\nElderly Man: You and your group\u2019s lives are already set to clash with the otherworldly denizens of this island.\n\nTobias: Wait, what? That\u2019s all you got?\n\nElderly Man: (Gives off an eerie smile) Yes.\n\nTobias: Alright. Enough with this. Come on Jay, we\u2019re wasting time here. We need to get back to the hotel and go over this footage.\n\n*The two turn to walk out but the man calls out to them just before they reach the door.*\n\nElderly Man: A word of advice.\n\nJamie: Yes?\n\nElderly Man: Make sure you have a camera on you wherever you go. You will get your proof, Mr. Lyndhurst.\n\n*The old man turns around and walks back to his chair as the two leave the building and walk down the hallway.*\n\nTobias: Yo, you buy any of that man?\n\nJamie: I didn\u2019t T. I didn\u2019t till just now.\n\nTobias: What do you mean?\n\nJamie: How did that guy know my last name? When the hell did we tell him who I was?\n\nTobias: (Long Pause) Shit man.\n\nJamie: So we\u2019ll carry on like normal. We had areas we wanted to check out. If the old guy is right then we keep the cameras rolling and we\u2019ll come across something. You brought the spare hand cams right?\n\nTobias: Yeah, all that stuff is back at our hotel. Why? You going to pass them out to everyone?\n\nJamie: Just the way he worded that, \u201cMake sure you have a camera on you wherever you go.\u201d I just think it would be a solid idea if we had cameras on us at pretty much all times while we\u2019re here in Japan. The hand cams don\u2019t have the best quality but we get what we\u2019ll get. A camera for everyone, okay?\n\nTobias: I feel ya. See that excitement in your eyes again Jay. It\u2019s nice, ya know? (Pats Jamie on the shoulder) You were in a dark place my friend. I was really worried about you.\n\nJamie: Yeah, well, I just have a feeling we\u2019ll find what we\u2019ve been looking for this time. We\u2019ll get that proof T, and then we\u2019ll go on to greater things.\n\n*The camera cuts out as they reach the van. The screen remains black with silence for half a minute before showing the group in a hotel room, presumably back in Tokyo.*\n\n*Note: It is at this point in the footage that the transcriber changed from Op-547 to Op-115. Op-547 left a detailed account of his final days hidden in this document and it was originally going to be removed and separated from this file but the final words of Op-547 will be left at the end of this file, as it is deemed supplemental to the entities involved. Please note that Op-115 does not have the same level of familiarity with Japanese mythology and relied heavily on notes found in Op-547\u2019s computer and residence. The remainder of this footage was also viewed using special equipment usually reserved for trapping and/or containing entities.*\n\nCandice: So wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. You want us each to carry a camera on us at all times? Like, you want me to lug one of those huge things around?\n\nJamie: T and I will carry our bigger cameras but we also brought some handycams along.\n\nBeth: Why did we bring those again? Those two cameras should be able to shoot everything we would\u2019ve needed.\n\nJamie: Well, these bad boys are kinda big like Candice said. On top of that I wanted us to be able to film anywhere. We can\u2019t sneak these in to certain areas.\n\nBeth: Oh. I guess I should\u2019ve known.\n\nJamie: Beth, hey, I just wanted to bring them in case. It\u2019s not like I planned to absolutely sneak around. And besides, now we can repurpose them so that everyone can film. Anyways, yes Candice, we need everyone to have a camera on them. It\u2019s just in case.\n\nTobias: You may not believe us but that old man said some creepy, convincing shit. It\u2019s just a minor annoyance for you guys to have one of these on with you.\n\n*The camera swivels to reveal Norm standing on the far side of the room, staring out the window. Jamie, who is holding the camera motions over to him and the group looks in his direction.*\n\nBeth: Norm, what\u2019s up? Kinda\u2026quiet over there.\n\nNorm: Sorry guys, I\u2019ve just been thinking about some stuff. We found that card with some\u2026 (Glances towards Candice) people right? And you guys said that those people found that with someone else right?\n\nJamie: Yeah, that\u2019s right.\n\nNorm: Did he mention what condition those other people were in?\n\nJamie: \u2026no. But I see what you\u2019re getting at. Alright guys, listen up, we\u2019re going to check out a bunch of places tomorrow right? Don\u2019t go anywhere alone tomorrow. I think that as long as we stay in groups we should be okay.\n\nCandice: What are you guys talking about? When did we find a card?\n\n*The group looks around at each other for a few moments.*\n\nBeth: Oh sweetie, you weren\u2019t feeling well remember? While you slept in the car we met with some people and they\u2026um, gave us the card that led us to that creepy guy.\n\nCandice: Oh, strange that I can\u2019t remember any of this.\n\nJamie: Well, you were very sick.\n\n*The group sits in silence for brief period of time before Candice stands up and walks over to the door.*\n\nBeth: Where you heading?\n\nCandice: I just need some ice guys. I\u2019m still feeling ill. Don\u2019t look at me like that, the ice machine was right around the corner and I\u2019ll even take the camera with me. Happy?\n\nJamie: Are you sure you don\u2019t want one of us to go with you?\n\nCandice: No, it\u2019s fine. I just want to stretch my legs and get some fresh air as well. A minute or two outside would probably do me some good.\n\n*Candice leaves the room and the group sits in relative silence. There is some conversation but it is muted and what phrases are picked up are not relevant to this file; mostly small talk. This is broken up by a woman\u2019s scream sounding out loudly. The group looks shaken and stunned for a moment before Jamie suddenly curses and scrambles for the door.*\n\n*The majority of the hotel appears to be indoors but the corner of the hotel was outdoors and housed several vending machines as well as a particularly noisy ice machine. The group runs down their hall to see that a small crowd had already formed. Jamie pushes through the crowd and finds Candice\u2019s camera lying by the guard wall and the floor is covered in glass from a smashed vending machine. He hurries over to the side of the building and lets out an audible sigh. Jamie must have assumed she had fallen over the side and expected to see a body. The camera\u2019s shakiness stops all of a sudden as he sees a strange figure staring up at him. The figure has their face concealed by what looks like a pale mask of some kind and is wearing a black, modern looking suit. The figure stares up at Jamie for a moment before turning and walking away.*\n\nJamie: Hey! You in the mask! Hey!\n\n*The figure ignores his shouts and walks further out of sight.*\n\nJamie: Shit.\n\n*Jamie snatches up the camera on the ground and fights his way back out of the crowd to see Tobias and Beth standing there.*\n\nBeth: Where's Candice?\n\nJamie: Come on, we gotta move quickly.\n\n*The three of them begin to briskly walk back to their room while Jamie speaks.*\n\nJamie: Something happened to Candice, not sure what. I found her camera on the ground. It looked like some sort of struggle and I'm guessing the camera picked it up. I saw some weird person staring up at me as I peered over the edge. They were wearing this creepy mask and I'm guessing they did whatever happened to Candice. Last I saw he was heading towards the shopping district.\n\nTobias: Shit man. Did we piss someone off?\n\nJamie: Or did we miss something off?\n\nBeth: My god...\n\nJamie: So you two get a head start and look for that person. They were wearing a black suit and wearing that mask. I'm going to drop this camera off with Norm real quick and then I'll join you guys.\n\nTobias: Alright. We're on it.\n\n*The trio arrives at the door and Jamie heads inside to see Norm staring out the window.*\n\nJamie: Yo, Norm, you okay?\n\nNorm: (Sound distracted) Yeah. I'm fine. Something on the building over there caught my eye. That's all. Oh, where's Candice?\n\n*Jamie points his camera up to the roof parallel them but nothing out of the ordinary is seen.\n\nJamie: She's missing. I found her camera and a likely suspect so we're going to look for them while you check out the footage.\n\nNorm: Yeah, that sounds good.\n\n*The footage suddenly cuts from Jamie's camera to Norm's handycam that is sitting on the dresser. From the angle it is recording from the viewer can see the opposing roof in the background. There's now something on the opposing roof. It doesn't show up clearly in the footage but it appears as a shimmery cloth blowing in the wind. Documents found in Op-547's house denote it as being an entity from Japanese folklore that lures people to madness or death. There wasn't a lot of documentation.*\n\n*Jamie tosses Candice's camera to Norm and the hurries back out the door. Norm flips over the and is assumed to have replayed the recording. Suddenly, the footage from her camera begins to play beginning with her backing out of the hotel room and heading towards the ice machine.*\n\n*When she is out of view of her friends it is clear that Candice is not as physically sound as she let on. Her gait becomes sloppy and she begins to stumble. Her breathing becomes ragged, and you can hear the labor in each breath. Stranger still is that the footage becomes more distorted and as her health deteriorates further. By the time she reaches the ice machine the footage is near unwatchable. Suddenly a hand reaches out and touches her shoulder and the static ceases. It's eerie how quiet it suddenly gets. Candice looks over to find a slender woman wearing a surgery mask.*\n\nCandice: Err...hello. \n\nWoman: (Translated from Japanese) Am I beautiful?\n\nCandice: Excuse me?\n\nWoman: (Translated) Am I beautiful?\n\nCandice: I'm sorry...I don't speak Japanese...\n\n*The woman grabs Candice around the wrist rather tightly.*\n\nCandice: Ow! You're hurting me. Please stop!\n\n*The woman pulls her surgery mask down to reveal a slit on either side of her mouth that cuts through the cheek and leaves her lower jaw hanging.*\n\nWoman: (Translated) Am I beautiful now?\n\n*Candice lets out a scream as she is pushed into the vending machine, thus breaking the glass. Her camera falls to the ground and her screams rapidly become distant. This is another entity that appears in Japanese folklore. Op-547's notes lead me to believe that it normally targets children and its main ways of killing are inducing the same mouth wounds or bisecting the victim at the waist.*\n\n*The footage cuts back to Norm's camera and he appears devastated as he sets down Candice's camera.*\n\nNorm: Oh Candice...she's gone. I can't believe she's gone.\n\n*The footage shows Norm sobbing for several minutes before the shimmering entity on the roof increases its amount of thrashing. Norm slowly looks up at it and appears to be in a trance state. He shambles to the sliding door and is shown leaning against the balcony for a brief amount of time. Without warning he reaches out to the shimmering entity and falls. A loud crash is heard followed by people screaming below.*\n\n*The footage make an abrupt cut to Beth's camera. She is running slightly behind Tobias with neither of them saying anything. Suddenly they hear a scream from an alleyway beside them. The two go to run towards it but there is then a crashing sound behind them. Beth swings her camera around to reveal the figure that Jaimie had recorded fleeing the scene. It is now clear that the figure is wearing a porcelain mask over their face. The masked figure had knocked over a stand, most likely in an attempt to get their attention.*\n\nTobias: I got this Beth! That scream sounded like Candice, get her and get out of here!\n\n*Tobias takes off in a sprint after the masked figure.*\n\nBeth: Be careful Tobias. We'll meet up later!\n\n*The crowd of people that had formed was quickly dispersing. None of the people would meet eye contact with Beth. By the time she had reached the entrance to the alleyway most of the people in the area were gone. She let out an audible sigh and then slowly entered the alley.*\n\n*The alleyway itself was tucked between two rather big buildings and much of the light from the main streets was blocked out. Beth carefully crept through the alley, stopping when she found a figure lying on the other side of a dumpster.*\n\nBeth: Candice? Is that you? Are you okay?\n\n*Beth approached the figuring and as she got closer a scratching noise can be heard.*\n\nBeth: Candice!\n\n*Beth gets close enough to the figure to see that it is Candice but she quickly stops and lets out a gasp. Candice has been bisected from the waist down and the scratching noise is coming from her spine sliding across the building wall. \"Candice\" suddenly lurches towards Beth at a speed that would put some of our Stalkers to shame. The camera falls to the ground and shows \"Candice\" pinning Beth to the wall. The footage quickly turns to static as the sounds of screaming are heard.*\n\n*The static eventually gives way to show a quick clip of Tobias be tackled to the ground by multiple people wearing the porcelain masks. The camera is left on the ground and depicts Tobias be drug into an alleyway. He fights back and kicks one of the masked figures in the face. A black substance pours out of a crack in the mask and it gives off a faint dark tinted mist. Tobias struggles to his feet and grabs the camera. He suddenly looks alarmed and swings the camera down on another masked figures head. The video cuts out but the sound of a struggle plays for another five minutes. It is unclear what happened during this time.*\n\n*An abrupt cut and the footage now shows Jaimie's point of view once more. He is back in the hotel room and looks extremely worried.*\n\nJamie: Jamie Lyndhurst here, I wanted to make a record in case something happened to me. Hell, something is going to happen to me. All my friends are either dead or missing. Norm jumped from our balcony. Beth, Candice, and Tobias are missing now. I haven't seen them for two days now. I can only imagine that the masked figure I saw had something to do with it. I'm not going to give up on them though. They wouldn't leave me, and I won't leave them.\n\n*There's a scratching noise coming from the direction of the balcony. Jamie sets the camera down but it is pointed towards the exit to the room, opposite the balcony.*\n\n*The following can only be heard.*\n\nJamie: (From the far side of the room) Candice? Oh my god, Candice I'll pull you up! Hold on!\n\n*The sliding glass door can be heard opening and a loud scratching noise can be heard.*\n\nJamie: Oh fuck, Candice?!\n\n*A feral growl is heard as \"Candice\" presumably pounces and attacks Jamie. The sounds of tearing flesh and gore splattering can be heard for a few minutes before the door to the hallway opens. A masked figure walks in and picks the camera up. As they turn around the balcony can be seen, briefly, covered in blood splatters and with chunks of meat strewn about. The figure turns the camera to its face once more before the camera and the compilation of footage ends.*\n\n*Analysis: All members of Jamie Lyndhurst's crew were eventually reported as missing by the Tokyo Metropolitan Force. This footage was actually released to the CIA by Japan's supernatural research Division: YGY. We believe YGY wants to better solidify its standing with what they consider the United States' Paranormal research division. They clearly do not pay much heed to our existence. This particular tape was found locked away in one of the CIA's Artifact Bunkers. We have multiple operatives on the inside that occasionally smuggle documents and artifacts.*\n\n*As for the Organization, it appears that little action will take place on our part. Until these porcelain clad figures attack our territory they have raised little suspicion by my superiors. I believe they are to be labeled as a cult dabbling with low tier entities.*\n\n*This actually brings up another avenue of research. We have a small team looking into why the ghosts and entities from Japanese Folklore exist solely on the island of Japan. Is it Tulpa? Is there a powerful entity that resides there and makes the various lesser entities appear? It is currently labeled as a low priority project.*\n\n*Case File: Closed.*\n\n*Update 04/22/06: Tobias found alive.*\n\n(Note from Secrets: I was way over the character limit for posts. The transcriber's recollection of events and a bit of musings can be found in the comments section below, really sorry about this guys!)"

Let\u2019s see some of what our good, touched friend was capable of before finding solace in sanity once more.*\n\n*Initial Interviews with _____ __________ after Agent T____ brought him in.*\n\nI\u2019ve been here for a week or so with you guys running tests on me, trying to get a handle on exactly what is wrong with me. We\u2019re all on the same page that it\u2019s something spooky and paranormal but you guys won\u2019t fucking tell me why you believe me so readily. So far you have me on a cocktail of pills that appear to do jack and shit. Now you want me to tell you a bunch of junk from my past? Fuck it, let\u2019s get started then.\n\nThroughout my life I\u2019ve had several instances of extreme violence. These acts were always preceded by emotional outbursts on my part and a\u2026\u201dvoice\u201d in my head taking things too far. Voice isn\u2019t exactly right though. It\u2019s strange, like I\u2019m getting commands but not willingly. Like a puppet that has to move based on someone pulling the strings. I know that makes it sound like I simply have no self-control but you guys seem to think there\u2019s something more wrong with me as well.\n\n*Event One: Backyard Football, Age Sixteen*\n\nI was living over on the east coast with my mum in this relatively small town. Close knit neighborhood and all that stuff. Well, all of us kids would get together and play in a field a ways down the road from where our houses were. Usually tag, or ride bikes, but occasionally we\u2019d play football. There were six or seven of us, I can\u2019t remember the exact numbers anymore but what does matter is that there was this one neighbor kid. He lived directly across the street from us and he was just this cocky, little shit. He was a grade below me in school so I imagine that would\u2019ve made him around fifteen years old. Now this kid and I always played on separate teams. I think it was because we were the oldest so it was just more fair to have us as the respective captains. Unfortunately this caused a bit of a rivalry to form. We were prone to getting cheap shots in on each other and getting into the occasional scrap. \n\nI remember one day we were particularly getting into it. We\u2019d both gotten some rough hits in and the name calling had already started. He had the ball and was running up to me. For whatever reason the \u201cvoice\u201d kicked in and my memories get fuzzy. I remember running up to him and grabbing his neck. I think I may have pulled him down hard or thrown him or something of the like because when I zoned back in he was several feet away from me and not moving. I found out later that he was still alive but paralyzed. At the time I ran home to my mum and she packed our stuff up immediately.\n\nWeird thing about mum, she knew something was up with me. I\u2019d had these bizarre outbursts my entire life. I\u2019ve had strange instance of sleepwalking and talking in my sleep. She had become convinced that I wasn\u2019t crazy but was in fact possessed. She tried a bunch of different things to cure me but nothing worked. And nothing terribly crazy happened during these attempts so just know that a variety of treatments for the supernatural were attempted to no avail.\n\n*Event Two: Assault On A Friend, Age Fifteen*\n\nThis would have occurred at the same residence as the previous entry. Me and that shit kid were already getting into our early scuffles at this point. I don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m not doing these in chronological order. Just run with it okay? We\u2019ll just do these as they come to mind. At least this way I\u2019ll get all the major stuff across.\n\nAnyway, right, we\u2019re still in that East Coast small town but the neighbor kid isn\u2019t wheelchair bound quite yet. We had just moved there pretty recently. Like, a year or so prior to what is about to happen. Why did we move\u2026? I can\u2019t remember. Oh shit, right. My older brother died. Uh, not because of me though. He was a nice enough kid but he never could handle dad\u2019s death from when we were younger. He fell into a bad crowd and abused drugs and stuff. That all caught up to him and he died. We moved to this town shortly after that to escape all the bullshit that comes with losing a family member. Do you even know how fake people can be? It\u2019s fucking disgusting. Unfortunately, I was actually emotionally compromised on top of having my strings pulled by the devil.\n\nSomehow I had managed to make friends with a select few kids and kept on my daily chore of trying to be a normal kid. One of my friends was not very tactful. I think I remember his name being Matthias or something like that. Anyway, I had just bombed a test had and he decided to ruthlessly tease me about it. For whatever reason I actually got pissed off and was about to scream at him in the middle of class when the \u201cvoice\u201d kicked in. My strings were pulled and I grabbed that kids head and bashed it on the desk several times. I vaguely remember dragging him out of the room and to a stairwell down the hall. Now, it gets blurry again but I believe I smashed his face against the brick wall several more times before tossing him down the stairs. All that really matters is that they found him missing a lot of teeth and with several broken bones.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking now and it\u2019s okay. How did I manage to assault a peer in the middle of class and then drag him from the room with no one knowing or stopping me? Okay, time for things to get weird again. Like I said, weird stuff happens when my strings get pulled. It seems like I have abilities that aren\u2019t my own like how I picked that kid up in football by his head. I can\u2019t recall the details but it seemed like time had sort of stopped when I attacked him, if that makes sense.\n\nIn the end the school had decided that my friend snuck out of the classroom and must have tripped down the stairs. He eventually recovered from his wounds, had some dental work done, and returned to school. I remember him claiming that he couldn\u2019t remember a thing but now that I think about it he never did talk to me after all that.\n\n*Event Three: Striking A Bully, Age Thirteen*\n\nOoh, this one was good. This is the first instance of me getting nasty. See, before this I was an avid reader, a complete bookworm. All that reading kept me centered, it was a way to block things out and ignore that urge to absolutely murder people. Unfortunately I apparently read too much as a kid and was subjected to a ton of bullying.\n\nThere was this one kid. I remember him pretty clearly actually. He definitely had hit puberty before me and judging from his appearance came from a home without much money. What I really remember is him lifting me up by my throat in the middle of science class because I wouldn\u2019t give him my homework. The science teacher looked up, shook his head, and went back to reading some novel at his desk. I was completely alone at that school. No friends to speak of.\n\nI eventually snapped and tried to fight back in the hallway but it didn\u2019t really work out. The kid was still way bigger than I was. I stood up for myself and got the shit kicked out of me. I remember there being so much anger but I held it in. I had not experienced the \u201cvoice\u201d to full effect at that point. I didn\u2019t know what I was capable of.\n\nI eventually called the bully out to meet on this old, abandoned bridge that ran through town. We met late at night after I snuck out of my house and through the city. I remember us fighting again. I actually don\u2019t remember why I even thought calling him out to that bridge was a good idea. He once again kicked the shit out of me. Until I snapped that is. This is my first clear memory of attacking someone and it not entirely being of my own volition. This is the moment where I started to really break as a human being.\n\nBefore I could even get a cognitive thought out my fingers were in his eye sockets, clawing out his eyes. The poor kid stumbled backwards and fell off the bridge. I believe they found his body a month or so later a few states downstream. I think I can confidently say this is when my oddness and violence ramped up.\n\n*Event Four: Lashing Out At His Stepfather, Age Sixteen*\n\nLet\u2019s see, oh! How about the time I attacked my piece of shit stepfather? This is roughly a year after I hurt that kid playing football. Mum was having trouble keeping us going financially and she ended up marrying this utter asshole who got off on beating the shit out of me on a daily basis.\n\nIt\u2019s a miracle that I lasted the amount of time I did without doing anything to him. As far as bad stepfathers go I\u2019d say it was par for the course. He had a bad temper, yelled at me if I didn\u2019t do \u201cmanly\u201d activities, beat me for making noise during the day, and beat me if I hid away in my room. It was seriously a troubling time. I wasn\u2019t sure how to please the dude.\n\nWell, one day he came into my room screaming at me. I can\u2019t remember what it was for anymore. Probably something trivial. Usually he\u2019d begin hitting me and we\u2019d call it a day but for whatever reason I couldn\u2019t ignore the urge to attack him. Things remain blurry to this day but when I came to he was lying on the ground with my television replacing the spot where his head was. It was a gory mess.\n\nI remember mum came home and was rather appalled. But she did what she always did and cleaned up the mess and started packing our things. We ended up skipping town that night.\n\n*Event Five: Collegiate Trouble, Age Eighteen*\n\nI remember this pretty well actually. This was my breaking point. I was still a functional human being but after this confrontation I ended up with that lust for death. Which, wait. Wait. I don\u2019t want to kill anyone right now. Shit. I guess those meds actually work.\n\nSorry, getting off track. It was my freshman year of college and I had joined a weekly athletic group. We played dodgeball, football, and capture the flag. It was all just for fun but it was a great way to snag exercise. There was this group of guys I didn\u2019t get along with. They actually weren\u2019t the jocks though. It was weird\u2026they were this group of overweight guys that were always really weird and doing the strangest shit. Creeping on girls, say bizarre things, the whole deal. For whatever reason they didn\u2019t like me much and would purposefully hit me rather hard. They actually managed to break my hand in a game of football once.\n\nOne night I finally snapped. Story of my life, right? Take a little shit and then explode. I followed the guys as they walked back to their truck in the far parking lot. Once again my strings were being pulled and I swung on the first guy I came across. The other two tried to attack me but I was in that mode. There was a tire iron in the bed of their truck and I had grabbed it at some point. When I came to I found it lodged in one of the guys heads. I had choked out another one of the guys. I think the worst thing is that I had driven the truck over another dude. I\u2019m guessing it was repeatedly because his head was not intact at all.\n\nIt was all downhill from there. Stalking and murdering people became my new passion. I would become known as a collegiate serial killer. And now I\u2019m here.\n\n*Tattle\u2019s Note: The subject was given a summary of the events that you know as Tattle\u2019s Tale.*\n\nSubject: So this is\u2026what?\n\nAgent T: Your past. Our past.\n\nSubject: Our past?\n\nAgent T: I know you don\u2019t remember clearly but we do know each other. I was your best friend _____. I\u2019ve spent most of my time in this Organization looking for you.\n\nSubject: But according to this my mum died way back then. How is that possible?\n\nAgent T: Your Dad remarried and tasked his new wife with curing you. She came to love you as much as your biological mom did.\n\nSubject: I\u2019m possessed then? That\u2019s why I do the things I do?\n\nAgent T: Yes. You and I stumbled across something a long time ago. Whatever it was took an interest in us and eventually began to feed off you. These people I work for, they fix these kind of problems. I convinced them to hire you on and I\u2019ll oversee your actions.\n\nSubject: Man, this is so sudden. I need some time to think on this.\n\nAgent T: Take all the time you need. It\u2019s good to have you back though _____.\n\n*Tattle\u2019s Note: The young man known on this Earth as Secrets would become my partner. We eventually found a way to harness the entity within him and he became an agent for my Organization 440. Unfortunately, this led to him being considered expendable and led to my eventual split with both that Organization and that Earth.*\n\nSo hey guys. This is the Tale that I\u2019ve been holding on to for over six months now. It definitely clears up who Tattle is and my relationship to him. But\u2026it\u2019s just rather personal. A lot of the stuff that happened to that Secrets vaguely resembles things that happened to me as well. It\u2019s neither easy nor fun to share that kind of stuff. I appreciate your time in reading these and I\u2019ll attempt to make more progress on Case File Twenty One.\n\nStay safe NoSleep."

        "body": "Read up on it if you do want to refresh your memory. It's been almost three years since we last heard about the E-byss and Alex Kepler.\n\n*Case File: 020-111*\n\n*Case File Date: 04/12/2003*\n\n*Location: Constance, Pennsylvania*\n\n*Subject: Robert Mills, Alex Kepler*\n\n*Entity: E-byss*\n\n*The following is a record of the interrogation of Alex Kepler.*\n\nInterrogator: Mister Kepler, you\u2019re a hard man to find.\n\nAlex: Yeah, I can imagine why you\u2019d say that. Seems like I\u2019ve missed a few things. World\u2019s kinda passed me by.\n\nI: And yet it looks like you have aged a bit. You look as young as ever.\n\nAlex: That sorta tends to happen when nightmarish creatures rip you from the ones you love and toy with everything you\u2019ve ever known. Seriously, you guys locked me up last time and I got taken. Now you have me locked up again and I imagine the same thing is going to happen again. You guys couldn\u2019t protect shit. Not me, not Mary, no one.\n\n*Mr. Kepler fumbles around in his pocked for a moment and looks down before maintaining eye contact.*\n\nI: Now that\u2019s not very nice Mister Kepler. I\u2019m going to have to ask you not to be so blunt. The Organization is run a little bit differently than the last time you were here. We will cut our losses if you prove troublesome.\n\nAlex: Alright, alright. I get the picture. You want me to tell my tale right? Fill you in and all that jazz? Gotcha. Let\u2019s start with Rob.\n\nI: One of the missing people from your police report?\n\nAlex: Yeah. Also, may I add that I am not happy that I had to tell my whole story to the police again? If your little group had picked me up earlier I wouldn\u2019t have to be the broken record. Seriously, my name should pop up and you guys should just be there. Especially with all this instant technology you have now.\n\nI: We have eyes and ears out globally. A person that\u2019s been deemed dead for years is hardly a priority.\n\nAlex: Fair point. So here, let me get out these notes. I found it in a guy named Rob\u2019s room shortly after arriving to that\u2026thing.\n\nI: The Organization has named that particular entity E-byss.\n\nAlex: Cute. (Mr. Kepler fumbles around in his back pocket and presents several pieces of paper folded up.) These tell Rob\u2019s story and have a bit of a bearing on mine. If it\u2019s fine with you I\u2019m going to try and read his notes and then tell my bit to get us a better understanding. There\u2019s actually some pretty important shit in here.\n\nI: That\u2019s more than fine Mister Kepler.\n\nAlex: \u201cI\u2019m writing this all down because something strange is happening. Something terrible that everyone in this area knows about. I have this feeling I\u2019m not going to be around much longer to tell people what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s that legend about the weird photographs. I remember a few of my parent\u2019s friends trying to talk about it when I was younger. They went on about a serial killer distributing the photos and abducting people. I think it\u2019s because those photographs started appearing again when I was a kid. It was a big scare in our community. Needless to say my parents suddenly parted ways with their closest friends and soon enough their house was vacant. I never saw them again. I bet that if I called my folks up right now they\u2019d deny knowing the couple and blame it on the faulty memory of a kid.\u201d\n\nAlex: So I\u2019m going to interrupt Rob\u2019s story here and assume that was your group taking people away.\n\nI: Entirely possible. I have a bit of a background with the E-byss case and from what I\u2019ve read up on the plan was to see if not invoking or reacting to the creature would make it go away. Some of these entities do the things they do because they enjoy the pain and panic that is inflicted. When we cleaned up after that mess in the 80\u2019s we left some very specific guidelines for the civilians who were more in the know. They were told that it was the work of a serial killer and that the killer had moved on to a new area. Families were not to talk about him for fear of that drawing the killer back.\n\nAlex: Fear tactics then. Did it work?\n\nI: I\u2019m afraid we have no way of knowing for sure. E-byss has only appeared twice since your first encounter with it so I can only speculate on whether putting a lid on the whole thing stifled its hunting activities or not.\n\nAlex: That\u2019s fair. I\u2019ll give you that one. Oh wait. Shit. My parents, what happened to my parents? I\u2019ve been so caught up with this shit that I forgot to ask.\n\nI: I thought you might ask, Mister Kepler, so I took the liberty of bringing up their file. Both of your parents are deceased. Your mother passed in the early 90\u2019s and your father passed a year ago. Both to heart disease according to this report.\n\nAlex: I see\u2026\n\n*Mr. Kepler once again breaks eye contact and briefly looks down.*\n\nI: As I\u2019ve said previously, I am the one in charge of investigating all E-byss related material and that includes keeping up with the families that are particularly close to the abductions. Your parents were kept under surveillance for their remaining years of life but broke no unspoken rules or attempted to blow the story. Their deaths were natural and not initiated by my facility or the entity we seek. You can read the reports on them if you\u2019d like\u2026\n\nAlex: No thanks. I appreciate it though. With me locked up here I doubt you\u2019d have any reason to lie to me now. So I\u2019ll take you at your word this time. Had they talked would they have been taken away like these other people were?\n\nI: It is entirely possible though it does depend on who was in charge of the E-byss investigation at the time. It has changed hands several times over the years.\n\nAlex: Okay. Well, let\u2019s get back to this letter then. We don\u2019t have all day before that things comes back to get me again.\n\nAlex: \u201cThere\u2019s always been this weird stigma in the area about photos. It\u2019s not just my town now that I think about it. The surrounding area is just the same. No one really gets their photo taken. No one has a camera. It\u2019s not like what you see if you leave the county or watch TV. Hell, people get upset when outsiders come to the area brandishing cameras. I\u2019ve actually seen families chased out of town due to this but always blamed it on stubborn people being old fashioned to the core.\u201d\n\nAlex: \u201cI was at a little reunion party when things started to happen. A group of us happened to come home from college for the weekend and met up with old friends. We found ourselves drinking and partying the weekend away. Nothing new there really. The issue is when the pictures started showing up. I can\u2019t really remember the exact time frame but it was after midnight. Josh found a stack of them on the patio. Whoever reading this has to remember, we had never had our pictures taken before. These pictures were of some photographer taking pictures of us in various public places. No one really said much after that. The party ended and everyone went home.\u201d\n\nAlex: I\u2019d just like to add in that I hadn\u2019t arrived yet. The E-byss or whatever you call it and I were not present. So from what I can gather I think these photos appear a bit before that thing arrives. I remember them being mentally taxing on my friends and I. That piece of shit likes to break you down, it gets you sick and then takes you when you no longer want to fight back. I imagine I\u2019m only around still because I was so dead set on finding the others. Anyway, back to Rob\u2019s letter.\n\nAlex: \u201cThe next few weeks were relatively quiet. Melody was the first one from that night at the party to contact me. From the sound of her voice I could tell that she had been crying and I had a hard time understanding a lot of what she was saying through the sobbing. There was one word that kept repeating though: photographs. Her apartment wasn\u2019t too far from my dorm so I assured her I\u2019d be over and booked it to her place. When I got to the apartment her roommate answered the door. She looked\u2026worried to say the least. The roomie told me that she had started acting strange after coming back from that party and that she had progressively gotten worse until the point where she won\u2019t come out of her room. I knocked on her door and let myself in. That place was a wreck though; I really wasn\u2019t prepared for how bad it would look. All the furniture in her room was thrown around, clothes everywhere, broken electronics, and just trash. Actually, the only thing still upright was a desk with a lamp on it. And laid out across the desk were a series of photographs. I remember the feeling that slammed into my gut then, I just remember the sense of dread that I felt.\u201d\n\nAlex: This seems to be exactly what happened to my friends and I. That piece of shit made a big display to us as a group and then picked us off one by one. It looks like Melody was its initial target much like Darren was for us.\n\nI: And do you know why it chose Melody and Darren as the first victims?\n\nAlex: You know, I didn\u2019t at first. (Trails off and sits quiet for a few moments.) How about you guys?\n\nI: We have a few theories. I don\u2019t believe any of them have gained solid ground however.\n\nAlex: Right. I\u2019ll clear that junk up. Let\u2019s just keep things chronological for now.\n\nAlex: \u201cI tried to talk to her but she stayed huddled up in a pile of debris located in the corner of her room. All she really did was point to the photographs and mumble under her breath. I couldn\u2019t blame her for being so\u2026touched after I actually saw the photos. I had the unfortunate pleasure to view them in sequential order. It started off innocently enough with that weird stalker picture of her. But you can see something change over the next two pictures. Something happens to her frame, like\u2026I can\u2019t explain it but she looked \u2018crooked\u2019. Further into the pictures the \u2018edges\u2019 of her begin to puff out. It looks like her body splits in half from the side as the front half of Melody is shown slumping in the picture. A more bloody and crazed Melody was shown inhabiting her frame and being cupped by Melody\u2019s back half. Honestly, it was disgusting. On that final picture I saw what looked like permanent marker bleeding through so I flipped it over to see \u2018END\u2019 written on the back. I\u2019d never get the chance to ask Melody her side of the things though. A loud crash brought me out of my stupor and I was suddenly all too aware that Melody had just thrown herself through the window of their third story apartment. I thought I heard a thud of some sort but that could have been my imagination filling in the blanks. Regardless, she did not survive the fall. Melody was gone and I really only had more questions.\u201d\n\nAlex: This all seemed pretty on par with how things went with Darren. This fucker seems pretty to have a gameplan when it comes to ruining people\u2019s lives. Melody did probably screw things up for it when dying though.\n\nI: How so?\n\nAlex: We\u2019re getting to that part.\n\nAlex: \u201cThe next several weeks have now become a blur to me. I haven\u2019t been to class. I stopped going out or eating. I haven\u2019t been replying to my friends\u2019 instant messages. I feel like I\u2019m losing who I am, it\u2019s utterly strange. I actually come to in other rooms just to find out a chunk of time has passed since my last memory. For some reason I keep finding myself wearing this old hoodie from high school. I don\u2019t even remember bringing it with me to college. Writing this out has grounded me somewhat though, enough that I am suddenly aware that something is quite wrong with me. Why have I only just noticed this stack of photographs on my desk?\u201d\n\n*Alex Kepler places the papers on the desk and checks something under the desk for a brief moment.*\n\nAlex: That\u2019s the last thing Rob would write and I think mere moments before I arrived.\n\nI: So this is where you arrive with the E-byss and Robert Mills is abducted.\n\nAlex: You\u2019re half right. I have little memory of being taken in 1984 but I do remember being enveloped by that bastard while locked up in your care. Everything goes dark and my next memory is slamming up against a wall in Rob\u2019s room.\n\nI: Are you sure? That is definitely your next memory? Robert Mill\u2019s apartment?\n\nAlex: Yes. Seriously, I wish I could tell you more about what that thing did but I can\u2019t recall anything, not a single memory. So I arrived by putting dent in the wall, knocked me silly for a few minutes. When I did come to I realized there was another dude in the room. I didn\u2019t know at the time but that was Rob.\n\nI: What was his reaction to you suddenly appearing in his room in such a violent manner?\n\nAlex: He was actually slumped over in his chair. While I was shaking the cobwebs out of my head I thought he was a corpse. I\u2019m actually still not sure whether he was breathing at that point or not?\n\nI: And why is that?\n\nAlex: Because he \u201cturned\u201d moments after?\n\nI: \u201cTurned\u201d?\n\nAlex: That\u2019s the best word I can use to describe what happened. His body suddenly jerked up. The guy\u2019s chest was pointed towards the ceiling his head and arms limp. It was a frightening experience. And that was before the hood on his hoodie slid up over his face\u2026\n\nI: Are you implying-\n\nAlex: Yes! Fucking right I am! Rob became the E-byss! I have no idea how I got time fucked but the E-byss took Rob. You can see the hints in his series of photos\u2026\n\n*Alex stops talking and zones out for several moments. Re-watching the footage of him it is clear that he pulls something out of his pocket and glances at it without the Interrogator noticing.*\n\nI: Mister Kepler? Alex?\n\nAlex: Yeah. Right. Sorry, I kind of just made a realization.\n\nI: About what?\n\nAlex: Well I\u2019m pretty sure the E-byss has to take a body from someone when it does that time jump shit. It was trying to take that Melody girl first. She killed herself and derailed this shit bag\u2019s plans so he took Rob. It was there in their photos. That means it took Darren. Darren was the E-byss for my group of friends\u2026that motherfucker.\n\nI: Would you like to continue things chronologically for me? What happened when the E-byss inhabited Rob\u2019s body?\n\nAlex: Well, the hood slipped up over his head while in that bizarre pose. I sat there still all unbalanced; I really hadn\u2019t recovered from that slam. I think I saw\u2026something go into Rob\u2019s mouth. It was weird though, like a gas of some sort. Even now I couldn\u2019t actually tell you if that\u2019s what I saw. Eventually the body relaxed and it twisted towards me. I saw that grin on the bastard\u2019s face, the same one he flashed me when he took Mary. It grabbed a floor lamp from beside the desk and walked up to me before bludgeoning me with it. Knocked me out again.\n\nI: But it didn\u2019t take you or kill you?\n\nAlex: I think it needs the photos to be in place, wearing you down. Maybe it can\u2019t hurt people without the psychological foreplay? \n\nAlex: I woke up in that room later. I can\u2019t tell you how much time went by because I don\u2019t know when I got there to begin with. There were some police sirens blaring in the distance. I do remember the sirens. The first thing I did was stumble into the bathroom. The blow to the head had split me open and my head was caked with dry blood.\n\nI: There\u2019s an indicator that you were out for some time, hours if not a day or two.\n\nAlex: Exactly. So, I patched myself up as best as possible and found my way back to the bedroom. Obviously I could go on about how different stuff looks now. But after pushing through my general unease with how alien my environment was I noticed the pictures and notes sitting on the desk. You see, Rob\u2019s pictures are kind of telling. They start out with a lot of voyeuristic shots of Rob. They actually give off the feeling that someone was following him. Rob eventually notices and you just see this\u2026violently angry look on his face and he pulls his jacket up so you can see his face near as well. It looks like the photographer continues to follow Rob who is now running away in all the shots and leads the photographer into some dark alleyway. The final few shots catch Rob striking the photographer with a pipe or length of wood of some sort. It gets covered in blood and gore rather quickly so it\u2019s hard to see. The final picture depicts Rob covered in the photographer\u2019s remains and now holding the camera. I think we can both see the implication here.\n\nI: Yes. The E-byss takes Rob.\n\nAlex: I read through his notes after that and started piecing things together. Seeing the date on Rob\u2019s letters was disturbing but made sense in a weird sort of way. If I had just suddenly woken up in 2003 it would\u2019ve been too much but all that stuff with the E-byss just made this icing on the cake. Not long after that the police beat down his down and hauled me in. That was a shit show though. Apparently that monster attacked one of its targets at a mall and made a relatively big scene. Someone from that party must have spoken up shortly after and police were sent to as many people from that party\u2019s houses that they could find. That\u2019s how they came to the apartment and arrested me.\n\nI: Indeed. Three people were taken at the mall. Onlookers described it as a hooded man that \u201cenveloped\u201d the now missing people. The security cameras in the mall blanked out one by one as soon as the E-byss would appeared in frame.\n\nAlex: So it\u2019s camera shy itself.\n\nI: It would appear so. Agile too. We have confirmed reports that it could stick to walls and ceilings and move at a rapid pace. A Josh Matthias, Amber Dempsey, and Tanner Patrickson are the three confirmed missing. All three of them were apparently at that party and thus targets for the E-byss. We only have a few eyewitness accounts to go on due to the loss of cameras. Patrickson was the first victim by all accounts. The boy was attacked at the food court. It was a rather standard attack for E-byss as well. No one really knows when the E-byss made its way into the mall due to its ability to more or less blend in as a hooded man so all we have is E-byss coming up behind Patrickson and enveloping him. \n\nAlex: Christ\u2026\n\nI: From there the a large portion of the crowd around the food court panicked and everyone in the mall eventually got riled up. Damage control was a nightmare for us.\n\nAlex: I can imagine. So it got the other two then?\n\nI: Yes. Dempsey was apparently in a changing room at a clothing store when the E-byss abducted her. Strange complication though, it would appear the abduction was not a clean one. We found a perfectly severed leg left behind. \n\nAlex: So she really fought to not be abducted. Damn\u2026\n\nI: Our thoughts exactly. Maybe there\u2019s some sort of dimensional shift and Ms. Dempsey\u2019s leg ended up on the wrong side of it.\n\nAlex: What about the final guy?\n\nI: Matthias disappeared in the parking garage. We could follow the E-byss by which cameras were blanking out and using that we were able to find Josh Matthias in the footage and watch as the downed cameras eventually crossed his path. No evidence left behind with him though so we\u2019re thinking it was another clean abduction. And I now need some more concrete answers from you Mister Kepler.\n\nAlex: Excuse me?\n\nI: I don\u2019t like being lied to.\n\nAlex: And I don\u2019t like being accused of lying.\n\nI: We have evidence that you were active in the city of New York, circa 1995.\n\n*Mr. Kepler is handed an image that a security camera took. It shows him walking through a crowd of people wearing the same clothes as he was currently in. Mr. Kepler begins to laugh hysterically.*\n\nI: What\u2019s so amusing Mister Kepler?\n\nAlex: Oh god, I actually was withholding some info from you but it wasn\u2019t this.\n\n*Mr. Kepler pulls a small stack of photographs out of his pocket and tosses them onto the table.*\n\nAlex: These photos have been appearing in my pocket periodically since this interrogation began. Looks like the E-byss has finished off those partiers and is coming to finish the job. I wasn\u2019t going to say anything and confront the E-byss on my own terms. Look, there\u2019s a wound on my head from getting attacked earlier. I think it\u2019s safe to say 1995 is my next stop.\n\n*The first photograph of Mr. Kepler depicts him standing at a New Year\u2019s Celebration that is for 2003. The photographs then progress to show him attending a New Year\u2019s Celebration in 2002, 2001, all the way to 1995. With every photo going back a year Mr. Kepler becomes more corpse-like until he is clearly diseased in the 1995 photo. This photograph also has the words \u2018END\u2019 written on the back.*\n\nAlex: Looks like I don\u2019t bite it quite yet.\n\nI: So it would seem. We need to get you moved now.\n\n*The Interrogator gets on a phone and begins to make calls to have Mr. Kepler transferred to a different facility.*\n\nAlex: Do you think you can catch it this time? Stop this monster?\n\nI: No. We now have proof you appear in 1995 some time after all of this so we clearly do not save you here. That isn\u2019t going to stop me from getting as many readings and recording on the E-byss as I can. Maybe we can stop it next time.\n\nAlex: And what about me? That won\u2019t help me back in 1995.\n\nI: I\u2019m sorry Alex. It looks like you may be on your own there\u2026\n\n*Mr. Kepler is rapidly moved to a sister facility with various E-particle machinery. The video cameras are all hooked up with E-spectral devices to counteract the dampening of footage. All rooms and hallways are bombarded with E-particles condensed into waves and projected across various frequencies to prevent the E-byss from just appearing in Mr. Kepler\u2019s room and abducting him without a fight. No staff are kept on the direct path to Mr. Kepler however, we know he gets abducted regardless of our efforts so no current staff should be compromised trying to save Mr. Kepler in vain.*\n\n*Status Report: Two days after moving Alex Kepler the E-byss made its move. It managed to materialize in a room much closer to Mr. Kepler than thought possible. This may be a testament to how strong the entity is. The cameras also managed to stay up for the most part. There was interference but nothing that managed to put any of the cameras out of commission.*\n\n*The entity appeared rather suddenly in a room down the hall from Mr. Kepler. There was no fanfare or initial burst of static. Once on film there was a low level of static interference but nothing shown by many of the other entities or on unmodified recording equipment. The movements of the E-byss were rather interesting as well. The entity seemed to phase between several spots rather rapidly while walking down the halls. We believe this is either a side effect of the E-particle waves interfering with the entity\u2019s ability to teleport or that this is a natural state of the entity that can\u2019t be perceived by the human eye. Regardless, it calmly and slowly made its way to the room where Mr. Kepler was held.*\n\n*Mr. Kepler was sleeping at the time of the abduction due to the late hours but we would have no way of knowing for sure what happened in the room. When the E-byss entered the room it glanced up at the camera and the camera shorted out. This brings up several questions as to whether the E-byss was toying with us or not. It may be that it allowed itself to be caught on tape and could have actually put an effort in to overcome the E-particle equipment. The results of the night are Mr. Kepler being abducted by the E-byss and presumably being taken to 1995. On a positive note we have collected an immense amount of data with hidden equipment and scanners. We believe it will take years to learn everything we can from these readings.*\n\n*Case File: Ongoing.*\n\nIt's surreal to finally see one of those unresolved Case Files being continued and out of all the people that we've followed I did not expect Alex Kepler to still be alive. Hell, I figured the E-byss had just bounced and wasn't going to really be an entity on our radar anymore and here it is time traveling and body snatching!\n\nThanks for staying with me everybody. The continued support of people who have explored these Case Files for three years with me and the newcomers as well is pretty much my largest motivation in life these days. I have a purpose. Thank you so much.\n\nStay safe NoSleep."

        "title": "Case File #22 The McFarrel's Scarecrows",
        "body": "*Case File: 036-010*\n\n*Case File Date: 06/23/1971*\n\n*Location: Leland, Idaho*\n\n*Subject: Billy McFarrel*\n\n*Entity: Scarecrows*\n\n*The following text comes from a notebook found lying in the McFarrel\u2019s barn. The notebook had strands of webbing on it and had appeared to be exposed for the elements for some time. It is presumably written by Billy McFarrel, the sole son of the family that owns the property.*\n\n*First Entry*\n\nI heard Ma and Pa arguing today. I guess a bunch of mean old birds tore into the crops again. Ma wanted to set up some scarecrows to scare them off and while Pa didn\u2019t seem too keen on the idea I think he\u2019ll come around. \n\nAlso, I was playing around in the barn today and I saw this huge spider. I tried to catch it in a jar to show Ma but she scolded me when I asked to borrow one of her jars. I went back to the barn to see if I could put the spider into something else but it was gone.\n\n*Second Entry*\n\nLooks like Pa caved and started making some of those scarecrows that Ma was talking about. I found him putting them together in the barn. I asked if I could help him but he yelled at me. I ran to Ma and she just said Pa was being stubborn and stuck in his ways.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find that pretty spider today. Maybe Pa and his scarecrows made him frightened.\n\n*Third Entry*\n\nPa finally finished his scarecrows and I can play in the barn again! I missed being able to go in there but something about those scarecrows put Pa in a foul mood. He would yell at me anytime I came near the barn.\n\nI\u2019m really excited to start hunting for that spider again. Maybe I can finally catch it and show it to Ma. \n\n*Fourth Entry*\n\nI woke up last night to Pa screaming at someone on the front porch. Ma ran to my room and told me that someone had been banging on the side door and walls of the house for a few hours now.\n\nWhen we woke up in the morning all the scarecrows had been moved out of the field and facing our front porch. Pa called the sheriff to see if any of the local boys had been caught be hooligans last night but the sheriff said there had been no other complaints.\n\n*Fifth Entry*\n\nI actually woke up last night to hear the banging. There must have been quite a few people running around last night because the banging seemed to be coming from everywhere! Ma came to my room and took me up to the attic while Pa grabbed his gun and ran outside. He fired it off a few times but told us that he hadn\u2019t actually seen anyone.\n\nThey had moved the scarecrows around again. They were all close to the house but this time they looked like they were peering through the windows.\n\n*Sixth Entry*\n\nThe banging at night has stopped. Pa thinks that it was a group of kids and that they must have gotten their kicks and moved on. I\u2019m just happy to be able to sleep the whole way through the night without Ma moving me to a different part of the house.\n\nI think I saw that spider again! I was playing in the barn today and I saw a mess of webs in the corner. I followed them to the edge of Pa\u2019s cornfield. I\u2019m not allowed to go into the field but I think I saw something moving in between the stalks.\n\n*Seventh Entry*\n\nIt looks like those hooligans may be back. I heard Pa talking to Ma during breakfast. He was talking about how someone is moving the scarecrows around still. I guess it\u2019s been happening every night since the knocking stopped but he didn\u2019t want to say anything since they weren\u2019t going near the house. Pa only told Ma because he found our old scythe from the barn propped up against one of them.\n\nThis is the worst. Now I have to come inside earlier because Ma is afraid one of those hooligans will get me. I\u2019m not scared of those meanies.\n\n*Eighth Entry*\n\nI made a new friend today! I don\u2019t know their name though. I was playing near the cornfield since Pa had to do some work in the barn and suddenly I saw someone running through the field. I thought it must be one of those hooligans that Ma was so upset with so I ran into the field to give them a piece of my mind. I was scared for a few minutes because I could hear people running through the field all around me. \n\nBut that\u2019s when I met my new friend! It was one of the scarecrows that Pa had made. He sort of waddled up to me and sized me up for a moment. Boy, he sure moved funny, like a puppet on a string. We ran around for hours but then I realized I was in Pa\u2019s field when it started to get dark. I sure was lucky, I managed to make it back to the house without Ma or Pa seeing my in the field.\n\n*Ninth Entry*\n\nI named my friend Husk today, like a corn husk! Luckily Pa was working in the barn again so I had waited by the field until Husk motioned closer. We played in the field for awhile and Husk led me to a place covered in webs. I bet he was trying to show me where that pretty spider had gotten off to. What a good friend he is.\n\nI wanted to tell Ma about Husk but when I mentioned it Husk seemed to get all rigid and stiff. I think he\u2019s shy.\n\n*Tenth Entry*\n\nPa got in trouble. I was playing with Husk again but this time Pa caught me in the field. I tried to show him that Husk was keeping me safe but I couldn\u2019t find him when I turned around. He is really shy. Pa dragged me out of the field and took me to the barn to paddle me. While I was getting paddled I looked out at the field and I could see all of Pa\u2019s scarecrows at the edge of the field looking at us. They seemed angry.\n\nLater that night the pounding started again but it was worse than it ever was before. I could hear the windows breaking and Ma ran to my room screaming. Pa grabbed his gun and ran outside. I heard him scream and fire his gun once but then it went quiet. No more banging, no more shouting, and no more Pa.\n\nMa made me stay up in the attic with her all night. When we went downstairs we found the whole place trashed. Every family picture had Pa scratched out. Ma called the sheriff and while they were talking in the kitchen I snuck out to check on Husk. I searched through the field and eventually came back to the webbed patch where Husk had taken me earlier. That\u2019s where I found Husk and Pa. Pa was wrapped up in webs but he looked like he was sleeping. Husk looked over at me and that\u2019s when Husk showed me his biggest secret! He pulled at the buttons on his shirt and that big spider from the barn crawled out. I can\u2019t believe how much of a dummy I was. Husk is the pretty spider! Anyway, I could feel that Husk needed to eat and I didn\u2019t want to lose my best friend so I said goodbye to my Pa and left. I knew Husk would never spank me for playing. \n\n*Eleventh Entry*\n\nThis is my final entry. I\u2019m going to go live with Husk and Ma. You see, Ma waited for a few days while the sheriff and his men searched for Pa but then she got scared. I heard her talking to the sheriff about how we were going to go move in with Gram Gram. I didn\u2019t want to lose Husk as my bestest friend so I snuck away and told him.\n\nHusk pointed towards a picture of Ma and I knew what he wanted me to do. Husk wanted to marry Ma. Husk wanted to be my new Pa! So I waited for the sheriff to leave and I called Ma out to the barn where Husk was waiting. Husk jumped down behind Ma to give her a surprise hug but Ma was mean and started screaming so Husk had to make her sleep like Pa used to do after drinking.\n\nWe have Ma tied down now and all of the other scarecrows have come out to play. Ma is so big now too. I was confused at first but I think Ma and Husk are going to have a babies. Boy, Husk sure isn\u2019t shy anymore. I\u2019m going to have a bunch of new brothers and sisters soon! Ma seems to be screaming a lot but I think that\u2019s just because she\u2019s confused. She doesn\u2019t know Husk like I do.\n\nIt sounds like my baby siblings are almost here! I can see them moving in Ma\u2019s tummy! Please don\u2019t come looking for us Mister Sheriff. We\u2019re starting our family in a new home.\n\n*The text in the notebook ends there coupled with a foreboding splash of rust colored blood on the page.*\n\n*Analysis: Researchers are unsure of what type of entity this was. It appears to be an intelligent spider of some sort but we have no way of knowing whether it is supernatural, mythological, or alien in nature. We\u2019ve collected some molting and webbing from the property and will continue to keep an eye on the region for arachnid or scarecrow related news.*\n\n*Case File: Ongoing.*\n\n*Boys will be boys.*\n\n*I'm back.*\n\n*Love, Tattle.*\n\nEdit: Just letting everyone know that I'm back from taking care of my sick fiance. I see Tattle is back to their weird ways. Fantastic."

        "body": "*Case File: 037-492*\n\n*Case File Date: 05/03/1996*\n\n*Location: Atlantic Ocean*\n\n*Subject: Robert Ferrell*\n\n*The following comes from an interview with Mr. Ferrell.*\n\nFerrell: You want to know what happened back out on the ocean right? That\u2019s more than fine. I\u2019ve told very few people up to now due to the Nondisclosure Agreement we\u2019re bound to. You guys must be pretty high up to get my bosses to break silence.\n\nOkay, so we were rooting around the bottom of the Atlantic right? We were looking for the lost city of Atlantis if you could believe it. Er, not that magical fairytale land you see in the stories. This was the real deal, a whole city at the bottom of the ocean untouched by anyone else. My employers were looking to gain credit for finding the site of the city as well as collect any loot. Noble, eh? But hey, we aren\u2019t government contracted so I guess its fair game.\n\nYou know, I\u2019m not really sure where the higher ups got the idea to start looking for Atlantis. The Atlantic was never really our territory. We had spent the majority of our time surveying the Pacific but one day they just announced the operation was moving to the Atlantic and that we were going to find Atlantis. I heard they got clued in from sources but that\u2019s a bit above my pay grade. \n\n*Mr. Ferrell\u2019s superiors were fed information from several members of Organization 440 from the Artifacts department. We believe we have more or less calculated the factual location of Atlantis through the use of several tomes kept hidden from the public eye. This plan was approved after we concluded on using Mr. Ferrell\u2019s group to front the cost and equipment as well as find the proof we needed to conduct our own research.*\n\nFerrell: So we have three submersibles that can be used to traverse the deeper parts of the ocean. Between the entire crew there are\u2026were five of us rated to operate them properly. I\u2019m one of the more senior members of the crew so I\u2019m often the first to go survey the ocean floor. It\u2019s truthfully exciting. Or at least it was. I\u2019m calling it quits and getting out of the game now.\n\nIt was looking like a pretty routine dive. The crew, myself included, was still getting used to the water but I was feeling optimistic. It may sound silly saying that one large body of water acts differently than another but there are things, minute changes. But Jesus, I was not prepared for what was going to happen.\n\nAs the first to dive it was up to me to get our bearings for the surveying the ocean floor. I was to look around a bit, pick out some markings, and generally just make it easier for everyone else to navigate and cover to ground. So\u2026I mean, that\u2019s what I did. I went down first in the bathysphere. I didn\u2019t have as much range as some of the other submersibles due to being connected to the ship at all times but the bathysphere is sturdy and I always took in as much information as I could to help the others. You know, I feel like that may have saved my hide.\n\nHmm\u2026getting carried away a bit there, eh? Sorry about that. So anyways, I was at the bottom of the sea right? Nothing new, nothing weird going on. I was down there for maybe ten, fifteen minutes tops before\u2026something happened. I swear that one moment it was rocky outcroppings and little bouts of murky water and then suddenly there were these structures amidst the rocks. They were these rectangular structures covered in the usual grime and foliage found at the ocean floor but they were indeed there. I don\u2019t know if it was a trick of the light or something in the oxygen tank of the bathysphere but for some reason I had looked away from the glass and that\u2019s when the structures had appeared.\n\nI stared at them for a while all awestruck and whatnot but before I could radio up to the ship about my findings I saw a figure from the corner of my eye shuffle behind one of the buildings. At the time I was really confused, as it looked kind of humanoid. Suddenly there was just thing general sense of dread in my system and I could not fathom why. For some reason I found myself up against the glass searching for whatever it was that had snuck behind the building. I kept thinking it must have been a large eel or some such. Unfortunately, I soon found out it was nothing so simple as an eel.\n\nFrom behind another structure somewhat closer to me I finally saw the humanoid figure for what it was and it was\u2026horrible. The skeletal structure of the being seemed to infer that the creature was tall but the flesh\u2026oh god, the flesh was stretched down towards the lower half of the creature\u2019s body. The skin around the skull was tight and the flesh from the jaw and down seemed to\u2026\u201dslump\u201d towards the creature\u2019s gut. You know, it looked rather like a hairless and horrific caricature of a person. The eyes were whited out and had what looked like algae growing out of them. The nose seemed to have mostly eroded away. It was just\u2026horrific. And then I saw that there were more. One lurched out from behind another building close to me. And then another. Another. Another. More and more. They shambled up to my bathysphere and pressed their misshapen faces against the glass. I truly believe that the sturdy nature of the bathysphere is the only thing that kept me safe. \n\nI panicked and radioed for them to bring me up. When I finally hit the surface and talked to the others they just wouldn\u2019t listen to me. Everyone was so excited about me finding the various structures on the sea floor but no one paid any mind to my ramblings about the creatures. They said I must have been paranoid or hallucinating and I was brought inside to rest. They sent down Brad Hensick after me in one of the lighter submersibles. Poor guy. I woke up to a bunch of panicked voices and the news that the submersible\u2019s hull had been compromised and Brad killed. Shortly after I guess you guys got involved and here we are\u2026\n\n*Mr. Ferrell was then led to believe that we were from the FBI and that this was a matter of national security. He seemed convinced but will be kept under surveillance. A research expedition is being planned using our own technology and crew. It\u2019s mission is twofold: survey the ruins of Atlantis for artifacts and capture at least one of the shambling creatures for study.*\n\n*Case File: Closed. Please follow up with The Atlantis Expedition.*\n\n*Tsk, tsk.*\n\n*The living should not disturb the makeshift tombs of those buried in the deep.*\n\n*Love, Tattle.*"

        "title": "Case File #24 Holy Oaks",
        "body": "*Case File: 055-133*\n\n*Case File Date: 07/11/1997*\n\n*Location: Woodsburgh, New Hampshire; Holy Oaks, Unknown*\n\n*Subject: Victor Gleason*\n\n*The following account by Victor Gleason comes from a handful of papers found in a briefcase. This briefcase was discovered on the side of the road on the outskirts of Woodsburgh, New Hampshire with the name Victor Gleason embroidered into the side. It picked up little steam in the local news before agents picked up on it and brought it in for analysis.*\n\n*The various papers are numbered in the corner but do not appear to be a chronological account of events. It is currently unknown who devised their current order and for what purpose.*\n\n*Entry One*\n\nDear Journal,\n\nI died again last night.\n\nLet\u2019s see, I think She stabbed me with scissors this time. Terribly painful if I remember correctly. I had been exploring a new part of this damn ghost town. Honestly, I was looking for a way out. Shit, I can\u2019t remember things too well right now. I guess scissors through the brain will do that. \n\nI was in some sort of office building. Wait, no, maybe it was a hotel. Regardless, I had been climbing up the stairwell when I suddenly heard her giggle echo out. The building was ten or so stories tall and I had no idea if She was above or below me so I sprinted upwards hoping to shake her with the fire escape. Unfortunately, She caught my ankle from under one of the stairs and promptly cut the ligaments and tendons.\n\nI screamed out in pain and took a tumble down the stairs, breaking more than a couple bones in the process. After falling for what seemed like an eternity I found myself on one of the floor landings in a crumpled heap of flesh. That had been enough to kill me, a few more minutes and I would\u2019ve have passed. \n\nBut She wouldn\u2019t let me. Oh no. She sauntered right up to me finger over her pale face and put the point of the scissors up to my temple. Without warning she started shoving the blade into my skull and that\u2019s where yesterday ends. I woke up in this bed as I always do. God damn it.\n\n*Entry Two*\n\nDear Journal,\n\nI had a dream I was murdered today. However, I\u2019ve now woken up in the same place where that dream started. And I can still remember everything so vividly. Was it a dream? And where am I? How did I get here? These questions remain unanswered. Regardless, I\u2019ll try to summarize my dream. Maybe it\u2019ll help me remember something.\n\nIn the dream I woke up lying in a cot. This cot was not located in my house but in an empty and dark apartment on the edge of a city I\u2019ve never seen before. This is where I find myself now, with nothing but my briefcase from work containing some writing utensils and some spare paper.\n\nAnyway, in my dream I left the apartment complex after finding it completely devoid of any people. The city wasn\u2019t any more inviting. It looked like the power was out across the whole city and I only had an overcast sky to guide me through. I remember it being surreal wandering throughout that city just trying to figure out where I could possibly be.\n\nAfter what felt like a few hours I finally came across another person. Amidst a slew of smaller skyscrapers, the twenty-story range, I found her. She was beautiful, skipping down the empty streets. She was pale, with hair as orange as the sunset, wearing a sundress colored the deepest shade of purple. I found myself instantly enamored with her and called after her. It didn\u2019t seem like she heard me though.\n\nI ran after her but couldn\u2019t find her. I remember hearing a female voice crying from an alleyway. I hesitantly entered the alley and found the woman\u2019s twisted body for my efforts. I crept up close to see if she was still breathing and then she leapt on me grabbing me around the neck. Everything gets hazy after that but it was a scary real dream. Hell, my neck still even hurts a bit. Crazy, right?\n\nThe windows in this apartment are covered up with old newspaper that I can\u2019t quite seem to tear off but it doesn\u2019t look too bright outside. If I am in that city from my dream perhaps I should look for that girl. Maybe it was some weird premonition.\n\n*Entry Three*\n\nDear Journal,\n\nShe got me yet again. \n\nIt seems like trying to leave the city spells out an instant death for me. I managed to get to a highway that looked like it would lead out of this eternally overcast urban hell of mine. But She was waiting. She sped at me with a truck that I never heard coming, pinned me against the side barricade and laughed to herself as I slowly bled out. \n\nSadistic bitch.\n\nBesides the stress that being stalked and repeatedly dying brings I seem to be relatively unharmed. I don\u2019t feel any less like myself, my energy levels are high, and I appear to be normal so I don\u2019t believe these deaths penalize me from any standpoint. They just sort of make me start over from the apartment again. Maybe this is a more of a game for her. Maybe I\u2019m just a toy. \n\nWhat did I do to deserve this?\n\n*Entry Four*\n\nDear Journal,\n\nI\u2019m starting to learn my way around the city. The apartment that I start in is in some sort of residential area in the city proper. I think its student housing for what looks like a campus few blocks away. I\u2019ve decided on calling it the Ward Phillips Housing Region due to the name of the university. Simple, but it\u2019ll help with the map I\u2019ve been working on. There\u2019s also a commercial region that houses most of the larger buildings and offices. That\u2019s where I first met her. The biggest of the offices is for a Bram Corp, so I\u2019ve creatively dubbed the region the Bram Commercial Area.\n\nIt\u2019s tough getting around though because I only have a given amount of time before my day comes to an abrupt end. I\u2019ve only made it to sundown twice before She comes for me. And sometimes I see her elsewhere, like peering down at me from a window while I\u2019m walking through the streets, or running by me real quick with a screech. I swear that when I catch her stalking me She appears more\u2026corpse-like. But that may be my imagination because every time She comes up close to finish me off She\u2019s clearly as beautiful as She has always been.\n\nAnd I\u2019m also fairly sure I\u2019m not dreaming anymore. Something bad is either happening to me or has already happened. Maybe I\u2019m in a coma or maybe this is something supernatural. Maybe I\u2019m already dead. I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s real enough that the dying hurts.\n\nI\u2019ve decided to just stay in the area and work on my map. She\u2019ll come for me eventually but until then I\u2019ll continue sketching out the area. I have to escape from the dreadful city.\n\n*Entry Five*\n\nDear Journal,\n\nIt took me awhile but I now know the name of the city I\u2019m cursed to wander: Holy Oaks. I have no idea where Holy Oaks is though. For as big as this city is you\u2019d think I\u2019d have at least heard of it. I still have no idea what state I\u2019m located in. The weather is mild enough to exclude large patches of the South but that still leaves a lot of ground to cover. Hell, I may be in Canada. Oh, but I should probably tell a bit about how I came across Holy Oaks.\n\nSo, a reoccurring issue for me has been locked doors, a lack of street signs, and basic other features from the average city. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019ve had a hard time getting around. But I\u2019ve continued to check the same buildings day after day in hopes of something changing. Today there was a door that wasn\u2019t locked in the commercial region, looked like a sandwich shop or something. Once I got inside I began to look around. I didn\u2019t find much but written on one of the walls was the phrase:  \u201cBest Burgers in Holy Oaks!\u201d. Not much of a find, but at least I now know where I am. As I was leaving the shop something happened. My memory is fuzzy but I\u2019m guessing that woman must have done something because I woke up back in my apartment. Maybe she dropped something on me? Fucking hell.\n\n*Entry Six*\n\nDear Journal,\n\nJesus. She came for me quickly yesterday. I had just finished recounting and jotting down my thoughts when She attacked me. Fucking hedge clippers to the left eye. I can still feel it burrowing through before it finally hit my brain. God damn her. \n\nShit. I hear someone humming outside the door. She\u2019s coming for me.\n\n*Entry Seven*\n\nShe threw out most of my notes. She attacked me while I was writing and in the struggle I forced her off me. She grabbed a handful of my notes and ran. Stupid fucking-\n\n*Entry Eight*\n\nCan\u2019t get away. She waits for me right when I wake up.\n\n*Entry Nine*\n\nSave me. Save me. Save me. Save-\n\n*Entry Ten*\n\nDear Journal,\n\nWho am I? I forgotten my name, I've forgotten who I am, I've forgotten why I'm here, I've forgotten who she is. But I feel so sorry. I feel so damn sorry. Please forgive me. Please, let me die. I'm ready for the end. I no longer have any desire to escape.\n\nIn Holy Oaks may I find rest.\n\n*The various pieces of the journal end here. Of note is that the map that Victor Gleason drew up was not found in the briefcase. It must still remain in Holy Oaks.*\n\n*After agents secured the briefcase the go ahead to search Gleason\u2019s house was given. In his basement was the decaying corpse of a woman with red hair in a purple sundress. She had sustained various injuries. Perhaps Gleason suffered a ghost\u2019s wrath. Regardless, this case is to be set to pending until more information on this Holy Oaks can be secured.*\n\n*Case File: Pending.*\n\nI've done a quick search for towns called Holy Oaks and I think I found a few hits for a place in Iowa. I don't believe it was a cityscape however, so it's entirely possible that Holy Oaks doesn't exist on this plane of existence. A pocket dimension? I have no idea.\n\nStay safe NoSleep."

        "body": "Be sure to read up on the previous File if you find your memory lacking.\n\n*Case File: 032-332*\n\n*Case File Date: 02/08/1991*\n\n*Location: William\u2019s Bend, Massachusetts*\n\n*Entity: Jack*\n\n*In the pursuit of the being known as Jack, Agent Hoffer was sent on his trail. Agent Hoffer acquired the following information that details more of Jack\u2019s activities.*\n\n*In early \u201991 there was an incident at a highway diner when several people picked a fight with the entity known as Jack. Agent Hoffer quickly appeared on scene and under the guise as an FBI official and interviewed one of the people that had witnessed the events. That man\u2019s account follows.*\n\nMan: That dude was already here when I got here. I wasn\u2019t paying too much attention at the time but I don\u2019t remember him moving around much, he just sat in the back corner nursing whatever drink he had. Actually, I do remember thinking that he was making a pretty big effort to keep his face covered up by his hood. It made him look sorta sinister. But, it\u2019s been a cold February so I brushed it off as a person wanting to stay warm and just started to enjoy my grub.\n\nThings stayed pretty quiet until a group of bikers rode in. The gangs that roam around here get pretty testy in the cold season so they were rather loud and confrontation when they arrived. I\u2019m guessing that the back corner seat must have been their usual hangout because they seemed kind of pissed that guy was sitting in it. I don\u2019t think they said anything to him at first though; instead the four of them sat in the booth next to his.\n\nSo the four of them were sitting there, two guys and two girls, and you could just see that things were going to escalate. The two dudes kept glancing up at the hooded guy and glaring at him. One of the waitresses actually went over and warned the guy but he just waved her off.\n\n\u201cWell, you were warned. It\u2019s your own damned fault for whatever you get now.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s what I thought to myself. At this point a lot of people were just watching all this go down. We knew we were about to watch this guy get the shit kicked out of him. I mean, of course I would call the police after it was all said and done but you don\u2019t just pass up on a free brawl.\n\nWhat happened next was\u2026holy shit. So after a little bit of talking himself up three of the bikers got up and walked to the side of that dude\u2019s table. One of the girls stayed at their table. One of the bikers pulled out this switchblade and said something to the hooded guy. I didn\u2019t catch what he said but the hooded guy ignoring him pissed him off so he slammed a fist down on the table.\n\nThe dude then suddenly leapt up and grabbed that biker by the throat. He was a stone cold motherfucker. The other biker dude takes out a knife as well. Not a little switchblade though, he had something like a bowie knife. He took that knife and just buried it in that guys arm. I\u2019d say it was brutal but he didn\u2019t even flinch. I saw him slowly turn his head to the biker that had just stabbed his ass and it was just\u2026a sight to see. I was intimidated and I wasn\u2019t even in the scuffle. And with little build up he takes the biker he\u2019s strangling and just shoves him face first into that switchblade on the table. That guy just got fucking iced. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m getting worked up, but seriously, it was messed up. I watched his body fall to the floor and the knife was just the whole way through his eye. One of the girl bikers let out a shrill scream and shit just fell apart from there.\n\nAs soon as blood was shed the guy in the hood changed. I don\u2019t know how to describe it exactly but he was very precise and rigid right? Like, an action hero or something? But after that biker hit the ground he got\u2026weird and wiggly? He kind of looked like a bad puppet on a string, as if the person pulling the strings didn\u2019t care about presentation. Shit, I don\u2019t man. That\u2019s just how it seemed to me. Regardless, that dude wasted no time turning his attention on the other biker who looked freaked the fuck out. The guy tried to run but the hooded dude just kind of bent along with him and grabbed him by the neck, swinging him down onto the ground. He inserted both of his thumbs into the biker\u2019s eyes. Guy had a weird obsession with eyes, right? (Nervous laugh) Anyway, and this is where shit gets nuts, he pulled the dude\u2019s head in half. Like, his skull snapped in half just because he pulled in two separate directions. Isn\u2019t that impossible? How fucking strong was this guy? \n\nAt this point everyone is just standing there and staring. The girl sitting at the table behind the hooded man is bawling her eyes out and the other one just looked horrified. I mean, for about a second. The hooded man wasted no time in dislodging that knife from his shoulder and shoving it in the gut of that woman. It was brutal too, he lifted her off the ground with it and I just watched as she slid down the damn thing. Fucking wow.\n\nOkay, and this is when things get really crazy. So the dude\u2019s face, like, peels apart right? And this fleshy, leech-looking thing comes out and slips into that girl\u2019s wound and starts\u2026spasming? I know you think I might be lying, but I fuck you not it was real. This got people moving. A few of the bigger guys ran over and tried to restrain him but he just threw them against the wall like it was nothing. Meanwhile he\u2019s got his\u2026whatever inside that woman and it\u2019s just making this god awful slurping noise and he\u2019s wiggling around like a puppet on crack. Jesus, her skin was stretching out all weird like with that thing moving around in her.\n\nAnd then suddenly it was over. That thing retracted back into his face and the dude and the woman just fell to the ground for a second with him heaving and her\u2026dead. That motherfucker got back up and started laughing. Like, full on psycho laugh and starts walking to the door. But as he walking by the table with the last biker girl at it he just grabs this glass, breaks it on the side of the table and then shoves it right into her face. Fucking vindictive, badass, motherfucker. I don\u2019t know any more that that. He walked outside and the rest of us just watched him. I wasn\u2019t getting involved. Seriously, what do you guys expect to do to something like\u2026whatever he is?\n\n*The interview ends.*\n\n*Agent Hoffer proceeded to follow up on all leads of violence in the area surrounding William\u2019s Bend.*\n\n*Only one incident piqued the interest of Agent Hoffer in his investigation. A bizarre, all female murder had occurred in a house in a rural house outside of the town. Agent Hoffer reported in that he wanted to act on Jack\u2019s desire for women and decided to focus his efforts on the murder scene.*\n\n*The following comes from Agent Hoffer\u2019s personal assessment and report on the murder scene.*\n\nLocal authorities haven\u2019t questioned my role in the FBI and access to the murder site was easily obtained. As for the murder scene it contained three corpses.\n\nAll three women contained wounds that were consistent between all of Jack\u2019s murders: slashes to the torso, torn flesh, and some organs completely missing from the bodies.\n\nThe only clue I have to go off of is a message left on the answering machine from some family of the victims staying in Texas. Jack likes to target families for some reason so it is safe to say that Texas is my next stop.\n\n*This ends Agent Hoffer\u2019s Report.*\n\n*Case File: Pending.*\n\nSo, more Jack and Hoffer. Good to see some things never change. I don't have much more to say other than I thought I'd share this File next since it was on the shorter side. I'm still working on a longer File as well and you can expect more from me then. In the mean time stay safe NoSleep."

        "title": "Parallel Case File #1 Earth-Z",
        "body": "Their timeline contains similar structure to our own before their point of divergence.*\n\n*Footage appears with Doctor Marlowe looking distressed in a security room.*\n\nI have made mistakes and in my hubris I fear I have doomed this planet. I honestly do not know if there will ever be anyone to witness what I\u2019ve done, but I will record it within these computers and hope that those who come after do not follow in my mistakes. First of all, let me show you some of my documents. I don\u2019t have the time to explain them so you will simply have to be intelligent enough to read through them when you stumble upon this footage.\n\n*Doctor Marlowe brings up various texts and documents that flash across the screen for brief amounts of time. We\u2019ve extracted the documents from the footage and had them analyzed and have come to several conclusions about Earth-Z\u2019s world and their version of the Hysteria Project.*\n\n*Our first conclusion is that Earth-Z had significantly less entities than our own Earth. In fact, besides the average spectral entity analogous with ghosts or spirits they lacked most other types of entities. Beings such as Volos, Subject 653, E-byss, and Jack simply did not exist in this world. This led to a safer world overall but had an interesting side effect where spectral hauntings and \u201cghosts\u201d became much more commonplace.*\n\n*Our second conclusion is that due to the lack of threatening entities that various paranormal organizations around the world received much less funding and all of them found themselves at a level of paranormal understanding far below what the organizations in our world are at. This meant that if a large paranormal or otherworldly force did threaten their world they would be that much more susceptible to it.*\n\n*Our final conclusion is that this version of Marlowe was getting desperate with his place within Organization 440. He was having a hard time getting any clout due to the lack of entities and subjects to study. This led to him attempting his own version of the Hysteria Project in an effort to create paranormal metahumans. In our own world Doctor Marlowe gathered pure P-Particles from Subject 653. The Earth-Z version of Marlowe used P-Particles cultivated from many lesser spectral entities. The P-Particles he used were quite unstable and\u2026\u201dweak\u201d in their own right. Had he have had access to stronger entities he would have seen the madness of using such low quality materials.*\n\n*Doctor Marlowe finishes flashing documents across the screen and falls into a chair.*\n\nI gathered several hundred subjects in an effort to infuse them with the P-Particles that we had extracted. I was hoping to create\u2026something new, something beyond the human race. There are hints of them out there, beings far beyond us. But for whatever reason they have barely left their mark. Instead, I\u2019m left with these damned\u2026echoes of a possible afterlife.\n\nI\u2019m afraid to say that the Project did not go as planned\u2026right from the very start the subjects began to expire due to the introduction of the P-Particles. If only I would have had actual matter from a paranormal being\u2026I feel the human body would be more than capable of surviving such an infusion. Regardless, I very quickly found myself with corpses as opposed to living subjects. Dejected and defeated, I decided to dispose of the corpses and start anew. That may have been a fatal error on my part.\n\nIt appears that the corpses were reanimated by the Particles infused into their very being. I do not know if they let us think them mere corpses so that we\u2019d toss them into an unprotected area or if the process took time to come into effect. The end result, however, was this facility being overrun by these\u2026shambling corpses.\n\nThese aren\u2019t some crude zombies or other form of bizarre fiction, but they do seem to work on the premise of converting normal human beings into them. Let me explain a bit more about the damned creatures and explain the process. I haven\u2019t had time to properly analyze any of these abominations but if I had to make an educated guess I believe the corpses are in a state of being possessed by the supernatural. I do not know if there is an entity behind them or if they are just feral beings. These monsters move quickly but in jerky, stuttered movements. They remind me of the puppet shows my family used to take me to when I was a child. They take physical punishment far beyond what a normal human being could take, and this trait has allowed them to\u2026reproduce in a manner of speaking. It appears that a rather large proboscis can be unfurled from the throat of each of these beings. They use this newly formed part of their body to inject something into their victims. The victim then goes limp and shortly after convulses, I believe this is when the body starts forming the proboscis using cellular material from the lungs, vocal chords, and esophagus. They then rise as yet another enemy against human kind.\n\n*It is our belief that due to Earth-Z\u2019s Doctor Marlowe injecting unstable P-Particles into the corpses that they gained this zombie-esque trait. Several researchers have proposed a theory that these \u201cVampiric Mannequins\u201d inject concentrated P-Particles into their victims. This seems to imply that the entities are capable of recreating the energy in their bodies. Perhaps more organs deep within the entity are altered to produce the P-Particles.*\n\n*Doctor Marlowe switches the screen to various security camera feeds.*\n\n*One of the feeds shows several unaware researchers being jumped by the mannequins in a dark hallway and converted.*\n\nThe entities broke out of the area we had stored them in for disposal. They quickly branched out and started infecting anyone within reach. Before the first hour passed I estimate that 80% of the facility was infected. There were several groups that made an effort to combat the entities.\n\n*The feed cuts to a group of security personnel in riot gear combating the mannequins in a much more sterile looking hallway. Despite their best efforts the shotguns and assault rifles that they wield do little damage to the encroaching mannequins and besides tearing into their flesh a little only serves to slow them down. The horde reaches the security team before they have a chance to retreat. Those men and women can do little more than scream while the mannequins tear off their riot gear, as well as the occasional limb, and shove their proboscis through any exposed flesh.*\n\nThe security teams\u2026they made a valiant if foolish stand but\u2026it wasn\u2019t enough. Small arms fire isn\u2019t near enough to curb these demons and I feel they just made themselves an easier target by directly engaging the monsters. I wonder if our lack of combat protocol for dealing with the supernatural is to blame for their quick demise.\n\n*The feeds cut to a group of researchers huddled in a laboratory with all entrances blocked off.*\n\nA fellow colleague of mine, Argus Hastings, managed to save a group of fellow researchers and they hid themselves away from the chaos. Unfortunately, one of the people he rescued suffered a nervous break and began screaming and fighting with the others. This drew the attention of the creatures in the surrounding hallway and it wasn\u2019t long before\u2026well\u2026I will miss Argus.\n\n*The feed suddenly cuts to a later point in time and the researchers are shown standing in the room frozen in odd places. The barricades are strewn across the room and it is clear that the researchers all suffer grievous wounds and have been infected.*\n\nI found myself in the control room talking to the Head of Security when this attack began. He had called me here to address concerns with the corpses. It appears that they had been moving around the rooms they were thrown in when no one was looking and a few of the custodial personnel were unnerved and reported it. I laughed off the situation at the time but in the middle of our conversation the red alert was sound. Last time I checked the Security Head was shambling somewhere around the main foyer area. He fell like all the rest.\n\n*The camera feed then begins to cycle through all the cameras in the facility. Every once in awhile a mannequin can be seen standing awkwardly in a hallway or room but it becomes clear that the hundreds of mannequins that should have been roaming those hallways were nowhere to be found.*\n\nIf I had to resign myself to being trapped in this facility with the mannequins for the rest of my life I could have lived with this. We would have remained trapped in this bunker and the world could have continued to pass us by. However, they found a way out. I\u2019ve been searching through the cameras to find the breach but all of the main doors remain locked down. I do know that the maintenance shafts and a few sections left over from the previous facilities\u2019 basement are not under surveillance. I assume they found a way out through a structural weakness. This facility lies on the precipice of a city and I fear the horde will only grow in size and ferocity.\n\nI plan to wait a few more days before I leave the facility myself. I have enough rations to last me and the entities are slowly leaving the building. It is my hope that the military will have enough firepower to curb the coming onslaught. I can only pray that there will be a surface for me to return to\u2026\n\n*The video footage suddenly cuts off and the screen goes to static.*\n\n*This is the first videotape that we recovered from Earth-Z\u2019s Doctor Marlowe. The Research Leads have already assured us that this particular dimension will never intersect with our world again but it is imperative that I the rest of this footage is combed over. I must know what happens to my alternate self.*\n\n_________________________\n\n*Poor, poor Secrets thought that besides the Tales he had the keys to the kingdom. How wrong, so wrong, he was. These events have little to no bearing on the events I'm trying to bring to light but I thought several of you may find them interesting regardless. I'll keep you hooked like a fish to bait. I need you to keep watching and reading. I may allow him to post to NoSleep as he pleases but CryoSleep is MY domain.*\n\n*As for my whereabouts I've been busy. Do not fret as your beloved Tattle has been pulling strings and working towards revenge. But please, do look forward to us peering into these doomsday scenarios on occasion.*\n\n*With love, Tattle.*"

        "title": "Case File #26 The Initiation of Remy Dubois",
        "body": "*Case File: 038-0-0*\n\n*Case File Date: 01/28/1999*\n\n*Location: Redacted*\n\n*Subject: Remy Dubois*\n\n*Remy Dubois, age 10, was the sole survivor of a paranormal attack. Both of his parents as well as his older sister perished. Agents were quick to pick up on Dubois and had him transferred to one of our facilities for interrogation and for use as possible fodder for a future project. However, it was quickly established that Dubois was suffering some \u201ceffects\u201d from his exposure to a paranormal entity and was instead brought in for testing and cultivation.*\n\n*The following is a brief initial interview with Dubois before his\u2026\u201dpossession\u201d was discovered.*\n\nInterviewer: Remy Dubois, it appears you have been through rather\u2026grievous circumstances. I understand if you have issues talking about what happened but the more you can tell us then the quicker we can find out what did this and hold them accountable.\n\n*Dubois remains in a catatonic state and looks like he\u2019s looking through the interviewer as opposed to acknowledging them.*\n\nI: Remy, we want to help find whatever killed your family. Please, could you help us?\n\n*There is no change in Dubois\u2019 behavior. Several more attempts were made to connect with the subject but he was unresponsive. Dubois was led back to the dormitory and allowed to rest for several days without much interaction with others. One of the researchers suggested that Dubois be allowed to play with some of the other children that were onsite. Many of them were being raised to be future agents and personnel for the Organization.*\n\n*The first indication that something was amiss with Dubois was in his interaction with fellow children. As if instinctually, most of the children flat out refused to go near Dubois, who had sat down in a far corner of the room. One of the older kids, a brute and natural bully, decided to provoke Dubois. The cameras do not have audio so it is unclear what the child said to provoke Dubois but suddenly Dubois rises up and snaps the child\u2019s neck with a rather tame looking strike. Upon reviewing the footage it is clear that a \u201cSpectral\u201d silhouette emanated from Dubois at the time of the strike. The child that provoked Dubois was sent to medical. He will live but most likely will never walk again. He is being funneled into a different facility as a test subject.*\n\n*A second interview with Dubois is held with the new knowledge that he has been altered from the events he experienced.*\n\nInterviewer: Remy, we know that there is something within you. Is it possible for me to speak to it?\n\n*Dubois\u2019 eyes focus clearly for the first time.*\n\nDubois: (Monotone) You can\u2019t talk to him.\n\nI: Why is that, Remy?\n\nD: He\u2019s sleeping. He\u2019ll be sleeping for a long time.\n\nI: Who is sleeping?\n\nD: I don\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t talk much. He\u2019s\u2026shy.\n\nI: Is this\u2026is he the one who killed your family. Remy?\n\nD: Yes.\n\nI: Why did he do that?\n\nD: He\u2019s\u2026young. He\u2019s a baby. And he was scared. Mommy and Daddy screamed and he...he made them go away. Big Sister didn\u2019t understand either. But I did. I know what it\u2019s like to be scared.\n\nI: How did you meet this\u2026shy being?\n\nD: I found an egg. I protected this egg and eventually it hatched. He came out of it.\n\nI: An egg?\n\nD: It wasn\u2019t a normal egg. Mommy and Daddy couldn\u2019t see it. Nobody could see it. The kids at school would make fun of me for it.\n\nI: What happened today with that other child? The one you hurt?\n\nD: He came up to me and started calling me names. That didn\u2019t bother me though. But he kept being loud\u2026he woke \u201chim\u201d up and he hurt that boy. I am sorry about that.\n\nI: Never mind him. He\u2019ll be okay; he just suffered a few bruises. So we would like to run a few tests on you just to learn more about the your new\u2026friend. They won\u2019t hurt you at all and we believe they won\u2019t wake him up. Would that be okay?\n\nD: Yeah. I think he\u2019s really tired from beating that mean boy up. I don\u2019t think you can wake him up easily right now.\n\n*Over the next several weeks the boy was put through various forms of safe and unobtrusive testing. It was a slow but safe process. We determined that an entity had indeed bonded with the boy. It seems to act like an \u201caura\u201d that originates in Dubois\u2019 core. When the entity surfaces to attack its being overrides that of Dubois temporarily. We do not know if the entity will grow to become powerful enough to fully control Dubois but it is a possibility.*\n\n*It has been decided that Dubois will be trained alongside our other child candidates for field agents.*\n\n*Remy Dubois \u2013 The Youth Initiative, 2001*\n\n*Summary: Remy Dubois shows a natural cunning and aptitude for making smart tactical choices on the fly. He maintains excellent physical prowess for a twelve year old that will only improve as he ages. Despite an initial setback getting him to come out of his shell Dubois\u2019 is quick to bond with and gain the trust of others making him a natural leader. He does not handle loss well however, and has a habit of breaking down when a fellow Initiate member is injured or killed. Dubois is a unique member of the Initiative as he is bonded to a paranormal entity. Beyond showing itself prominently when they first bonded and in times of severe duress it appears to now be dormant. It is hoped that he will eventually form a connection with the entity and be able to synergize with it to be a more valuable asset to our interests.*\n\n*Notable Achievement: During a Training Op Dubois was assigned as the head of Bravo Team. Their mission was to infiltrate a mock facility through any means necessary. They would be graded on how efficient and creative they acted. Dubois led Bravo flawlessly to the facility's rear wall. He somehow detected a previously unknown structural weakness in the wall and set a charge to breach it. The rest of this Op progressed smoothly and Dubois led Bravo to the best time.*\n\n*Notable Incident One: Dubois had a particular girl that he liked. She was a an unnamed orphan and followed our naming scheme as Jane Six. The various Janes and Johns usually used the number in their name as their nickname thus she went by Six. Dubois and Six grew to be exceptionally  close and she was often assigned as the second in command of Dubois' Ops teams. At the end of the first year of The Youth Initiative various teams were pitted against each other to form a ranking system. Teams were led to an arena and fought one on one fights. They were told that they were allowed to go all out to win and that killing an opponent would not be held against them. Dubois' team went up against a very competitive rival team that had been constantly behind them in the tests. During the skirmish Six found her neck snapped, enraging Dubois passed what we had previously seen. He killed three of the opposing team's members before succumbing to the security forces. After this event Dubois never grew any closer to his remaining squad mates, other Initiative members, or staff.*\n\n*Notable Incident Two: Following the death of Six Dubois was susceptible to lashing out against anyone around him. It was decided that he should be mentally evaluated to see if he was still fit for the program. It was during this time period that the team realized that the entity bonded to him was starting to manifest again. On the security footage of his door room it was shown that his body was moving around while he was asleep. He'd stand over his squad mate's beds for hours or stare into the camera. Various scanners were used to record him during this behavior and we found that there was a tall, slender silhouette that was superimposed over his frame. It was naked to the human eye but using the scanner it became clear that the entity could use him like a puppet while he was asleep. This reached new heights when he smothered his remaining squad mates in their sleep one night. Dubois had inhibitors surgically implanted in him to force the entity dormant once more. It was then decided that he would have to be cultivated outside of The Youth Initiative.*\n\n*Assignment: Remy Dubois has been scheduled for standard mind scrubbing. He is to have the specifics of the passed few years removed from his active memory until we decide to activate him as an agent. He will be in \u201cSleeper\u201d status until that moment arises. His programming will lead him to believe that he had been raised at an orphanage after his family died in a freak accident. He will be slotted into the foster care system and we will keep him under constant watch. We will try to instill a desire for him to excel both physically and mentally so that he can be at peak usefulness upon activation.*\n\n*Conclusion: Remy Dubois is one of our most promising budding agents. That paired with his bond to an entity make him an invaluable asset to the Organization. His unstable personality means that he must be kept under surveillance at all times however.*\n\n*Subject\u2019s Status: Not Activated.*\n\nHey Nosleep, Secrets here. Looks like we have something new this time, a subject file of sorts. Knowing how Tattle operates I would imagine we'll see more of this Remy in the future.\n\nIn other news I noticed that Tattle slipped a [File of his own](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryosleep/comments/4zyvvs/parallel_case_file_1_earthz/) on to Cryosleep. If you missed it due to it not being on Nosleep please give it a read now. It was a fascinating tale to say the least. I had no idea that the Organization was following parallel dimensions so closely. \n\nI don't understand why Tattle had to taunt me though. I don't get him. At times he tries to act like...an older brother? A father? A mentor? I dunno. And then other times he acts like this weird, aggressive psychopath. What's your deal, Tattle? You aren't my best friend.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think about both Files. I'm looking to fuel some interesting conversations in the comments section. As always, stay safe."
